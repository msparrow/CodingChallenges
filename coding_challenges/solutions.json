  "1": "The \"Two Sum\" problem is a classic interview question that tests your understanding of basic data structures and algorithms.  The most efficient solution uses a hash table (dictionary in Python) to achieve O(n) time complexity.  Here's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef two_sum(nums, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds two numbers in a list that add up to a target value.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A list of integers.\n        target: The target sum.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target, \n        or None if no such pair exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    num_map = {}  # Create a dictionary to store numbers and their indices\n\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num  # Calculate the complement needed to reach the target\n\n        if complement in num_map:\n            # If the complement is already in the dictionary, we found a pair\n            return [num_map[complement], i]  \n        else:\n            # Otherwise, add the current number and its index to the dictionary\n            num_map[num] = i\n\n    return None  # No pair found\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnums1 = [2, 7, 11, 15]\ntarget1 = 9\nprint(f\"Indices for target {target1} in {nums1}: {two_sum(nums1, target1)}\")  # Output: [0, 1]\n\nnums2 = [3, 2, 4]\ntarget2 = 6\nprint(f\"Indices for target {target2} in {nums2}: {two_sum(nums2, target2)}\")  # Output: [1, 2]\n\nnums3 = [3, 3]\ntarget3 = 6\nprint(f\"Indices for target {target3} in {nums3}: {two_sum(nums3, target3)}\")  # Output: [0, 1]\n\nnums4 = [3,1,5,7]\ntarget4 = 10\nprint(f\"Indices for target {target4} in {nums4}: {two_sum(nums4, target4)}\") # Output: [1, 3]\n\n\nnums5 = [1,2,3]\ntarget5 = 7\nprint(f\"Indices for target {target5} in {nums5}: {two_sum(nums5, target5)}\") # Output: None\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** A dictionary `num_map` is created. This dictionary will store each number in `nums` as a key and its index as the value.  Dictionaries provide O(1) average-case time complexity for lookups, insertions, and deletions.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through the `nums` list using `enumerate` to get both the index (`i`) and the value (`num`) of each element.\n\n3. **Complement Calculation:** For each number, it calculates the `complement` needed to reach the `target`.\n\n4. **Lookup in Dictionary:** It checks if the `complement` exists as a key in `num_map`.\n   - If the `complement` is found, it means we've found a pair that adds up to the `target`. The function immediately returns a list containing the index of the `complement` (obtained from `num_map`) and the current index `i`.\n   - If the `complement` is not found, the current number and its index are added to `num_map`.\n\n5. **No Pair Found:** If the loop completes without finding a pair, the function returns `None`.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` list.  We iterate through the list once.  Dictionary lookups are O(1) on average.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case.  The `num_map` dictionary could potentially store all the numbers from the input list if no pairs are found early.\n\n\nThis solution is significantly more efficient than a brute-force approach (nested loops), which would have O(n\u00b2) time complexity.  The use of a hash table (dictionary) is key to achieving the optimal O(n) time complexity.\n",
  "2": "The problem involves adding two numbers represented as linked lists where digits are stored in reverse order.  Here's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef addTwoNumbers(l1, l2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adds two numbers represented as linked lists.\n\n    Args:\n        l1: The first linked list.\n        l2: The second linked list.\n\n    Returns:\n        A linked list representing the sum of the two input linked lists.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    dummy_head = ListNode(0)  # Create a dummy head node to simplify the logic\n    current = dummy_head\n    carry = 0\n\n    while l1 or l2 or carry:  # Continue until both lists are processed and carry is 0\n\n        val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0  # Handle cases where one list is shorter\n        val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0\n\n        sum_digits = val1 + val2 + carry\n        carry = sum_digits // 10  # Integer division to get the carry\n        digit = sum_digits % 10    # Modulo operation to get the digit\n\n        current.next = ListNode(digit)  # Create a new node with the digit\n        current = current.next       # Move to the next node\n\n        l1 = l1.next if l1 else None  # Move to the next node in l1 or set to None\n        l2 = l2.next if l2 else None\n\n    return dummy_head.next  # Return the next node after the dummy head\n\n\n# Example Usage\nl1 = ListNode(2, ListNode(4, ListNode(3)))\nl2 = ListNode(5, ListNode(6, ListNode(4)))\n\nresult = addTwoNumbers(l1, l2)\n\n#Print the result (Helper function for readability)\ndef print_list(node):\n    while node:\n        print(node.val, end=\" \")\n        node = node.next\n    print()\n\nprint(\"Sum of linked lists:\")\nprint_list(result) # Output: 7 0 8\n\nl3 = ListNode(9, ListNode(9, ListNode(9)))\nl4 = ListNode(1)\nresult = addTwoNumbers(l3,l4)\nprint(\"\\nSum of linked lists:\")\nprint_list(result) # Output: 0 0 0 1\n\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **ListNode Class:** This class defines a node in the linked list, containing a value (`val`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`).\n\n2. **addTwoNumbers Function:**\n   - **Dummy Head Node:** A dummy head node is created to simplify the handling of the beginning of the resulting linked list.  This avoids special case handling for the first node.\n   - **Iteration:** The `while` loop continues as long as there are elements in either `l1` or `l2`, or a carry value exists.\n   - **Handling Shorter Lists:**  The `if l1 else 0` and `if l2 else 0` handle cases where one list is shorter than the other.  If a list is exhausted, its value is treated as 0.\n   - **Sum and Carry Calculation:** The digits from both lists and the carry are added. The carry is calculated using integer division (`//`), and the digit is obtained using the modulo operator (`%`).\n   - **Node Creation:** A new node with the calculated digit is created and appended to the resulting linked list.\n   - **List Traversal:** The pointers `l1`, `l2`, and `current` are updated to move to the next nodes in the lists.\n   - **Return Value:** The function returns the next node after the dummy head, which is the beginning of the actual sum linked list.\n\n3. **Example Usage:** The example shows how to create linked lists and use the `addTwoNumbers` function.  The `print_list` function is a helper for visualizing the output.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the addition of two numbers represented as linked lists, correctly managing carry-over and handling lists of different lengths.  The use of a dummy head node simplifies the code and improves readability.\n",
  "3": "The problem asks for the longest substring within a given string that contains no repeating characters.  We can solve this efficiently using a sliding window approach combined with a dictionary (or hash map) to track character indices.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        The length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = len(s)\n    # mp stores the current index of a character\n    mp = {}  \n    max_len = 0\n    start = 0\n    for end in range(n):\n        if s[end] in mp and start <= mp[s[end]]:\n            # If character is repeated within the current window\n            start = mp[s[end]] + 1  # Move the start of the window past the repeated character\n        else:\n            max_len = max(max_len, end - start + 1)  # Update max length if necessary\n\n        mp[s[end]] = end  # Update the character's index\n\n    return max_len\n\n#Example Usage\nstring1 = \"abcabcbb\"\nstring2 = \"bbbbb\"\nstring3 = \"pwwkew\"\nstring4 = \"\"\nstring5 = \"dvdf\"\n\nprint(f\"Length of longest substring without repeating characters in '{string1}': {longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(string1)}\") # Output: 3\nprint(f\"Length of longest substring without repeating characters in '{string2}': {longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(string2)}\") # Output: 1\nprint(f\"Length of longest substring without repeating characters in '{string3}': {longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(string3)}\") # Output: 3\nprint(f\"Length of longest substring without repeating characters in '{string4}': {longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(string4)}\") # Output: 0\nprint(f\"Length of longest substring without repeating characters in '{string5}': {longest_substring_without_repeating_characters(string5)}\") # Output: 3\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `n`: Stores the length of the input string `s`.\n   - `mp`: A dictionary to store the last seen index of each character.  This is crucial for efficiently tracking repeated characters.\n   - `max_len`:  Keeps track of the maximum length of the substring found so far (initialized to 0).\n   - `start`:  The starting index of the current sliding window.\n\n2. **Sliding Window:**\n   - The code iterates through the string using a `for` loop with `end` as the index of the current character being considered.  `end` represents the right boundary of the sliding window.\n\n3. **Character Check:**\n   - `if s[end] in mp and start <= mp[s[end]]:`: This condition checks if the current character (`s[end]`) is already present in the `mp` dictionary *and* if its previous occurrence is within the current window (i.e., its index is greater than or equal to `start`).\n\n4. **Window Adjustment:**\n   - `start = mp[s[end]] + 1`: If a repeated character is found within the window, the `start` index of the window is moved to the position immediately after the previous occurrence of that character. This effectively shrinks the window to exclude the repeated character.\n\n5. **Max Length Update:**\n   - `max_len = max(max_len, end - start + 1)`: If the current character doesn't cause a repetition within the window, the length of the current substring (`end - start + 1`) is compared with the current `max_len`, and `max_len` is updated if a longer substring is found.\n\n6. **Index Update:**\n   - `mp[s[end]] = end`: The last seen index of the current character `s[end]` is updated in the `mp` dictionary.\n\n7. **Return Value:**\n   - Finally, the function returns `max_len`, which represents the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, because we iterate through the string only once. The space complexity is O(min(m, n)), where m is the size of the character set and n is the length of the string, due to the use of the `mp` dictionary.  In practice, the space complexity is often closer to O(m) because the dictionary only needs to store the unique characters within the longest substring.\n",
  "4": "The optimal solution to the \"Median of Two Sorted Arrays\" problem leverages binary search to achieve O(log(m+n)) time complexity.  Here's a Python implementation with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the median of two sorted arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        nums1: The first sorted array.\n        nums2: The second sorted arrays.\n\n    Returns:\n        The median of the two sorted arrays.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    A, B = nums1, nums2\n    total = len(A) + len(B)\n    half = total // 2\n\n    if len(B) < len(A):  # Ensure A is the shorter array for efficiency\n        A, B = B, A\n\n    l, r = 0, len(A) - 1\n\n    while True:\n        i = (l + r) // 2  # Partition A\n        j = half - i - 2  # Calculate partition in B (adjusting for 0-based indexing)\n\n        A_left = A[i] if i >= 0 else float('-inf')\n        A_right = A[i + 1] if i + 1 < len(A) else float('inf')\n        B_left = B[j] if j >= 0 else float('-inf')\n        B_right = B[j + 1] if j + 1 < len(B) else float('inf')\n\n        if A_left <= B_right and B_left <= A_right:\n            # Partitions are valid. Find median.\n            if total % 2 == 0:\n                median = (max(A_left, B_left) + min(A_right, B_right)) / 2\n            else:\n                median = max(A_left, B_left)\n            return median\n        elif A_left > B_right:\n            # A's partition is too high, move left in A\n            r = i - 1\n        else:\n            # A's partition is too low, move right in A\n            l = i + 1\n\n\n#Example Usage\nnums1 = [1, 3]\nnums2 = [2]\nprint(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 2.0\n\nnums1 = [1, 2]\nnums2 = [3, 4]\nprint(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 2.5\n\nnums1 = []\nnums2 = [1]\nprint(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2)) #Output: 1.0\n\nnums1 = [1,2]\nnums2 = []\nprint(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1,nums2)) #Output: 1.5\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Binary Search Approach:** The core idea is to efficiently find the partition point in the shorter array (`A`) that, when combined with a corresponding partition in the longer array (`B`), divides the merged sorted array into two halves with equal (or nearly equal) numbers of elements.  This is done using binary search on the shorter array.\n\n2. **Partitioning:** The `i` variable represents the partition point in `A`, dividing it into `A_left` and `A_right`.  `j` is calculated to create a corresponding partition in `B` such that the total number of elements to the left of both partitions equals `half` (the middle index of the merged array).\n\n3. **Validation:** The `if A_left <= B_right and B_left <= A_right` condition checks if the partitions are valid.  If this is true, it means we have successfully found the correct partition, and the median can be calculated.\n\n4. **Median Calculation:**  The median is calculated based on whether the total number of elements is even or odd.\n\n5. **Binary Search Iteration:** If the partitions are invalid, the binary search adjusts `l` and `r` to narrow down the search space until the correct partition is found.  `float('-inf')` and `float('inf')` handle edge cases where partitions fall outside the array bounds.\n\n\nThis algorithm guarantees O(log(min(m, n))) time complexity because the binary search is performed on the shorter array.  The space complexity is O(1) as it uses only a constant amount of extra space.  This makes it significantly more efficient than merging the arrays completely (O(m+n) time).\n",
  "5": "The solution below addresses the \"Reverse Integer\" problem efficiently and handles potential overflow issues.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_integer(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses a 32-bit signed integer.

The absolute value of `x` is then used for easier manipulation.\n\n2. **Iterative Reversal:** The `while` loop iteratively reverses the digits.\n   - `pop = x % 10`:  This extracts the last digit using the modulo operator (`%`).\n   - `x //= 10`: This integer division removes the last digit from `x`.\n   - `reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + pop`: This builds the reversed number.  We multiply the existing `reversed_num` by 10 to shift the digits to the left and then add the `pop` digit.\n\n3. **Overflow Check:**  This is the crucial part.  Before updating `reversed_num`, we check for potential overflow:\n   - We compare `reversed_num` against the maximum and minimum values a 32-bit signed integer can hold, divided by 10.  This is because multiplying `reversed_num` by 10 in the next step might cause overflow.\n   - The additional check `(reversed_num == (2**31 - 1) // 10 and pop > 7)` and  `(reversed_num == -(2**31) // 10 and pop < -8)` handles the edge cases where the value is already at the maximum/minimum and adding even a single digit would exceed the limit.\n\n4. **Return Value:** Finally, the function returns the `reversed_num` multiplied by the original sign to restore the correct sign.  If an overflow occurred, it returns 0.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it avoids string conversion (which would be less efficient for large numbers) and directly manipulates the integer.  The overflow check prevents incorrect results and ensures the function adheres to the problem's constraints. The code also efficiently handles both positive and negative integers and their respective overflow conditions.\n",
  "6": "The solution below utilizes a list of strings to simulate the zigzag pattern.  It iterates through the input string, placing each character into the appropriate row based on the current direction (down or up).\n\n```python\ndef zigzag_conversion(s, numRows):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a string into a zigzag pattern and then reads it line by line.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The input string.\n        numRows: The number of rows in the zigzag pattern.\n\n    Returns:\n        The converted string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if numRows == 1 or numRows >= len(s):  # Handle trivial cases\n        return s\n\n    rows = [\"\"] * numRows\n    row = 0\n    direction = 1  # 1 for down, -1 for up\n\n    for char in s:\n        rows[row] += char\n        row += direction\n\n        if row == numRows - 1 or row == 0:  # Change direction at the top and bottom\n            direction *= -1\n\n    return \"\".join(rows)\n\n\n# Example usage\ns = \"PAYPALISHIRING\"\nnumRows = 3\nresult = zigzag_conversion(s, numRows)\nprint(f\"Zigzag conversion of '{s}' with {numRows} rows: '{result}'\")  # Output: PAHNAPLSIIGYIR\n\n\ns = \"PAYPALISHIRING\"\nnumRows = 4\nresult = zigzag_conversion(s, numRows)\nprint(f\"Zigzag conversion of '{s}' with {numRows} rows: '{result}'\")  # Output: PINALSIGYAHRPI\n\n\ns = \"A\"\nnumRows = 1\nresult = zigzag_conversion(s, numRows)\nprint(f\"Zigzag conversion of '{s}' with {numRows} rows: '{result}'\") # Output: A\n\ns = \"ABCD\"\nnumRows = 4\nresult = zigzag_conversion(s, numRows)\nprint(f\"Zigzag conversion of '{s}' with {numRows} rows: '{result}'\") # Output: ABCD\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handle Trivial Cases:** The function first checks if `numRows` is 1 or greater than or equal to the length of the string. In these cases, no zigzag conversion is needed, so the original string is returned directly.\n\n2. **Initialize Rows:** A list `rows` is created to store the characters of each row. It's initialized with empty strings, with the length equal to `numRows`.\n\n3. **Iterate Through String:** The code iterates through each character in the input string `s`.\n\n4. **Append to Row:**  Each character is appended to the appropriate row in `rows` based on the current `row` index.\n\n5. **Change Direction:** The `direction` variable controls whether we're moving down (1) or up (-1) the zigzag pattern. The direction changes when we reach the top or bottom row (`row == numRows - 1` or `row == 0`).\n\n6. **Join Rows:** Finally, the `\"\".join(rows)` method concatenates all the rows together to form the final zigzag-converted string.\n\n\nThis approach is efficient because it iterates through the string only once, making its time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case (when `numRows` is very small), due to the `rows` list.  In the best case (numRows is very large or equals the length of the string)  the space complexity is O(numRows) which would be smaller than O(n).\n",

The function immediately returns `False` if `x` is negative.\n\n2. **Handle Single-Digit Numbers:** Single-digit numbers are always palindromes.  The function returns `True` if `x` is less than 10.\n\n3. **Reverse the Number:** The core logic involves reversing the integer.  This is done using a `while` loop:\n   - `digit = x % 10`: This extracts the last digit of `x` using the modulo operator (`%`).\n   - `reversed_number = reversed_number * 10 + digit`: This adds the extracted digit to the `reversed_number`.  We multiply `reversed_number` by 10 to shift existing digits to the left, making space for the new digit.\n   - `x //= 10`: This performs integer division to remove the last digit from `x`.\n\n4. **Comparison:** After the loop finishes, `reversed_number` contains the reversed version of the original number.  The function compares `original_number` and `reversed_number`.  If they are equal, the number is a palindrome, and `True` is returned; otherwise, `False` is returned.\n\n**Why this approach is efficient:**\n\nThis solution avoids converting the integer to a string, which is generally less efficient.  Using integer arithmetic directly is faster and more memory-efficient, especially for large numbers.  The time complexity is O(log10(n)), where n is the input number, because the number of iterations in the while loop is proportional to the number of digits in the number.  The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a few variables to store the numbers.\n\n\nThis improved explanation provides a clearer understanding of the algorithm and its efficiency.

The key insight is that the area is determined by the shorter line and the distance between the lines.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef max_area(height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum area of a container formed by two lines.\n\n    Args:\n        height: A list of integers representing the heights of the lines.\n\n    Returns:\n        The maximum area of the container.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_area = 0\n    left = 0\n    right = len(height) - 1\n\n    while left < right:\n        # Calculate the area for the current pair of lines\n        area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)\n        max_area = max(max_area, area)  # Update max_area if necessary\n\n        # Move the pointer of the shorter line inward\n        if height[left] < height[right]:\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            right -= 1\n\n    return max_area\n\n\n# Example usage\nheight = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]\nmax_water = max_area(height)\nprint(f\"The maximum area of the container is: {max_water}\")  # Output: 49\n\n\nheight = [2,3,4,5,18,17,6]\nmax_water = max_area(height)\nprint(f\"The maximum area of the container is: {max_water}\") #Output: 17\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `max_area`: Stores the maximum area found so far (initialized to 0).\n   - `left`: Pointer to the leftmost line (index 0).\n   - `right`: Pointer to the rightmost line (index len(height) - 1).\n\n2. **Two-Pointer Approach:**\n   - The `while left < right` loop iterates, comparing pairs of lines from the left and right ends.  This is a crucial optimization, avoiding a brute-force O(n^2) solution.\n\n3. **Area Calculation:**\n   - `area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left)`:  The area of the container formed by the current pair of lines is calculated. The height is limited by the shorter of the two lines (`min(height[left], height[right])`), and the width is the distance between the lines (`right - left`).\n\n4. **Maximum Area Update:**\n   - `max_area = max(max_area, area)`: The `max_area` is updated if the current area is larger.\n\n5. **Pointer Movement:**\n   - `if height[left] < height[right]: left += 1 else: right -= 1`: The key to efficiency. The pointer of the *shorter* line is moved inward. This is because moving the taller line inward cannot possibly increase the area (the height will be at most the same, and the width will be smaller).\n\n6. **Return Value:**\n   - The function returns `max_area`, representing the largest container area found.\n\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of lines, because we iterate through the list once using the two-pointer approach.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space.  The algorithm is in-place.  This makes it a very efficient solution to the problem.\n",
  "9": "The solution below uses a greedy approach.  It iterates through the Roman numeral values from largest to smallest, subtracting as many instances of each value as possible from the input integer.\n\n```python\ndef int_to_roman(num):\n    \"\"\"Converts an integer to a Roman numeral string.\n\n    Args:\n        num: The integer to convert (1 <= num <= 3999).\n\n    Returns:\n        The Roman numeral representation of the integer as a string.

If not, it returns an empty string.  This is crucial because the Roman numeral system traditionally doesn't represent numbers outside this range.\n\n2. **Roman Numeral Mapping:** A dictionary `roman_map` stores the mapping between integer values and their corresponding Roman numeral symbols.  Crucially, it includes the subtractive cases (4, 9, 40, 90, 400, 900) for efficiency.  The keys are sorted in descending order (implicitly, due to dictionary iteration order in Python 3.7+).\n\n3. **Greedy Approach:** The code iterates through the `roman_map` in descending order of values. For each value:\n   - It checks if the current `num` is greater than or equal to the value.\n   - If it is, it repeatedly adds the corresponding symbol to the `result` string and subtracts the value from `num` until `num` is less than the value.  This ensures we use the largest possible Roman numerals first.\n\n4. **Result:** Finally, the function returns the accumulated `result` string, which contains the Roman numeral representation of the input integer.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it avoids unnecessary comparisons and iterations. By processing the values from largest to smallest and using a greedy strategy, it directly builds the Roman numeral string. The use of a dictionary provides a clear and concise way to manage the mapping between integers and Roman numerals.\n",
  "10": "The 3Sum problem requires finding all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero.  A brute-force approach (checking all possible combinations) is O(n\u00b3), which is inefficient for larger arrays.  A more optimized solution uses a two-pointer technique after sorting the array.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef threeSum(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists, where each inner list represents a unique triplet that sums to zero.\n        Returns an empty list if no such triplets exist.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = len(nums)\n    result = []\n    nums.sort()  # Sorting is crucial for the two-pointer technique and duplicate handling\n\n    for i in range(n - 2):\n        # Skip duplicate numbers for the first element of the triplet\n        if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:\n            continue\n\n        left = i + 1\n        right = n - 1\n        target = -nums[i]  # We need to find two numbers that sum to -nums[i]\n\n        while left < right:\n            current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]\n\n            if current_sum == target:\n                result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])\n\n                # Skip duplicate numbers for the second and third elements\n                while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:\n                    left += 1\n                while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:\n                    right -= 1\n\n                left += 1\n                right -= 1\n            elif current_sum < target:\n                left += 1  # Move left pointer to increase the sum\n            else:\n                right -= 1  # Move right pointer to decrease the sum\n\n    return result\n\n#Example Usage\nnums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]\nprint(threeSum(nums))  # Output: [[-1, -1, 2], [-1, 0, 1]]\n\nnums = [0,1,1]\nprint(threeSum(nums)) # Output: []\n\nnums = [0,0,0]\nprint(threeSum(nums)) # Output: [[0,0,0]]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Sorting:** The `nums.sort()` line is crucial.  Sorting allows us to efficiently skip duplicate triplets and use the two-pointer technique.\n\n2. **Outer Loop:** The outer loop iterates through the array up to `n-2` because we need at least two more elements to form a triplet.\n\n3. **Duplicate Handling (Outer Loop):** The `if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]: continue` line skips duplicate numbers for the first element of the triplet. This prevents duplicate triplets from being added to the result.\n\n4. **Two-Pointer Technique:**  For each `nums[i]`, we use `left` and `right` pointers to search for two numbers that sum to `-nums[i]`.\n\n5. **Inner Loop (Two-Pointers):** The `while left < right:` loop is the core of the algorithm.  It adjusts `left` and `right` based on whether `current_sum` is less than, equal to, or greater than the `target`.\n\n6. **Duplicate Handling (Inner Loop):** The `while` loops inside the `if current_sum == target:` block skip duplicate numbers for the second and third elements of the triplet, ensuring uniqueness in the result.\n\n7. **Time Complexity:** The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n\u00b2), where n is the length of the input array, due to the nested loops.  The sorting step is O(n log n), but it's dominated by the nested loops' complexity.\n\n8. **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) if we ignore the space used for the output list `result`.  The extra space used by `result` depends on the number of triplets found, which in the worst case could be O(n\u00b3), but is often much smaller.\n\n\nThis optimized approach significantly improves the efficiency compared to a brute-force solution.  The use of sorting and the two-pointer technique is a key element in solving this problem effectively.\n",
  "11": "The most efficient solution to the 3Sum Closest problem uses a combination of sorting and two-pointer technique to achieve a time complexity of O(n^2).

This allows us to use the two-pointer technique efficiently.  Sorting takes O(n log n) time.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The outer loop iterates from `i = 0` to `n - 2`.  We only need to go up to `n - 2` because we need at least three elements for the sum.\n\n3. **Two-Pointer Technique:** For each `i`, we use two pointers, `left` and `right`, pointing to `i + 1` and `n - 1` respectively.  These pointers define a window within the sorted array.\n\n4. **Sum Calculation:**  `current_sum` is calculated as the sum of `nums[i]`, `nums[left]`, and `nums[right]`.\n\n5. **Closest Sum Update:** We compare the absolute difference between `current_sum` and `target` with the current `closest_sum`. If the new difference is smaller, we update `closest_sum`.\n\n6. **Pointer Movement:**\n   - If `current_sum` is less than `target`, we increment `left` to increase the sum.\n   - If `current_sum` is greater than `target`, we decrement `right` to decrease the sum.\n   - If `current_sum` equals `target`, we've found an exact match, and the function immediately returns `target`.\n\n7. **Return Value:** After iterating through all possible triplets, the function returns `closest_sum`, which represents the sum closest to the target.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) due to the nested loops (outer loop iterates n-2 times, inner while loop iterates at most n times). The sorting step is O(n log n), which is dominated by the O(n^2) term.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1) (constant extra space) if we ignore the space used by the sorted array (in-place sorting is possible).  If we consider the space used by sorting (depending on the sorting algorithm), it could be O(log n) in some cases or O(n) in others.  However, the dominant factor is the O(n^2) time complexity.\n",
  "12": "The problem requires generating all possible letter combinations corresponding to a given digit string.  We'll solve this using backtracking.  Backtracking is a recursive approach where we explore all possibilities by making a choice at each step and then undoing that choice to explore other options.\n\nHere's the Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef letterCombinations(digits):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all possible letter combinations from a digit string.\n\n    Args:\n        digits: A string containing digits from 2-9.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of strings, where each string is a letter combination.\n        Returns [] if the input is empty or contains invalid digits.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not digits or any(not '2' <= c <= '9' for c in digits):\n        return []\n\n    keypad = {\n        '2': 'abc',\n        '3': 'def',\n        '4': 'ghi',\n        '5': 'jkl',\n        '6': 'mno',\n        '7': 'pqrs',\n        '8': 'tuv',\n        '9': 'wxyz'\n    }\n\n    result = []\n\n    def backtrack(combination, next_digits):\n        # Base case: If there are no more digits to process, add the current combination to the result.\n        if not next_digits:\n            result.append(combination)\n            return\n\n        # Get the letters corresponding to the current digit.\n        digit = next_digits[0]\n        letters = keypad[digit]\n\n        # Iterate over the letters and recursively explore combinations.\n        for letter in letters:\n            backtrack(combination + letter, next_digits[1:])\n\n    backtrack(\"\", digits)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ndigits = \"23\"\ncombinations = letterCombinations(digits)\nprint(f\"Letter combinations for '{digits}': {combinations}\")  # Output: ['ad', 'ae', 'af', 'bd', 'be', 'bf', 'cd', 'ce', 'cf']\n\ndigits = \"\"\ncombinations = letterCombinations(digits)\nprint(f\"Letter combinations for '{digits}': {combinations}\")  # Output: []\n\ndigits = \"23a\"\ncombinations = letterCombinations(digits)\nprint(f\"Letter combinations for '{digits}': {combinations}\") #Output: []\n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`letterCombinations(digits)` function:**\n   - It first checks for invalid input: empty string or digits outside the range 2-9.  If invalid, it returns an empty list.\n   - It defines a `keypad` dictionary mapping digits to their corresponding letters.\n   - It initializes an empty list `result` to store the generated combinations.\n   - It calls the `backtrack` function to perform the recursive exploration.\n\n2. **`backtrack(combination, next_digits)` function:**\n   - **Base Case:** If `next_digits` is empty (no more digits to process), it means a complete combination is formed.  This combination (`combination`) is appended to the `result` list.\n   - **Recursive Step:**\n     - It takes the first digit (`digit`) from `next_digits`.\n     - It gets the letters (`letters`) associated with that digit from the `keypad`.\n     - It iterates through each `letter` in `letters`.\n     - For each `letter`, it recursively calls `backtrack` with:\n       - An updated `combination` (adding the current `letter`).\n       - The remaining `next_digits` (excluding the processed digit).\n\n**How Backtracking Works:**\n\nThe `backtrack` function explores all possibilities systematically. Imagine a tree where each level represents a digit, and branches represent the letters for that digit.  The `backtrack` function traverses this tree depth-first:\n\n- It goes down one branch (chooses a letter).\n- It continues down until it reaches the end (no more digits).\n- It then backtracks (goes up one level) and explores another branch.\n- This process repeats until all branches are explored.\n\n\nThis backtracking approach ensures that all possible letter combinations are generated efficiently without redundant calculations.  The time complexity is O(4^N * N), where N is the number of digits (because each digit can have at most 4 letters, and we concatenate the results).  The space complexity is O(N) due to the recursive call stack.\n",

If it equals the `target`, the quadruplet is added to the `result`. If it's less than the `target`, `left` is incremented; otherwise, `right` is decremented.\n\n5. **Duplicate Handling:**  The `while` loops within the `if current_sum == target` block handle duplicate numbers for the third and fourth elements, preventing the same quadruplet from being added multiple times.\n\n6. **Time Complexity:** The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n\u00b3), a significant improvement over the brute-force O(n\u2074).

The `fast` pointer is moved `n` steps ahead of the `slow` pointer.\n\n3. **Iteration:**  Both pointers move simultaneously until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list.  Crucially, when `fast` is at the end, `slow` is positioned `n` nodes from the end.\n\n4. **Node Removal:** The `slow` pointer's `next` pointer is updated to skip the node that needs to be removed. This effectively removes the node from the list.\n\n5. **Return Value:** The modified head of the linked list is returned.\n\nThis two-pointer approach avoids a second pass through the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(L), where L is the length of the list, and a space complexity of O(1), as we use only a constant amount of extra space.  This is significantly more efficient than the two-pass approach, which would have a time complexity of O(2L) = O(L).\n",
  "15": "The solution uses a stack data structure to efficiently track open brackets.  The algorithm iterates through the input string:\n\n1. **Open Bracket:** If an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '[') is encountered, it's pushed onto the stack.  The stack keeps track of what needs to be closed.\n\n2. **Close Bracket:** If a closing bracket is encountered:\n   - The stack is checked to see if it's empty. If it is, the string is invalid because there's no matching open bracket.\n   - If the stack is not empty, the top element (the most recently opened bracket) is popped.\n   - The popped bracket is compared to the current closing bracket. If they don't match (e.g., a '}' encountered but a '(' was last opened), the string is invalid.\n\n3. **End of String:** After iterating through the entire string, if the stack is empty, it means all open brackets were properly closed, and the string is valid.  Otherwise, there are unclosed brackets, making the string invalid.\n\n\nHere's the Python code:\n\n```python\ndef isValid(s: str) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if a string containing parentheses is valid.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The input string containing parentheses.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the string is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []  # Use a list as a stack\n    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}  # Mapping of closing to opening brackets\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char in bracket_map.values():  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in bracket_map.keys():  # If it's a closing bracket\n            if not stack or stack.pop() != bracket_map[char]:  # Check stack and matching bracket\n                return False  # Invalid if stack is empty or brackets don't match\n        else:\n            return False # Invalid character\n\n    return not stack  # True if stack is empty (all brackets closed), False otherwise\n\n#Example Usage\nprint(isValid(\"()\"))  # True\nprint(isValid(\"()[]{}\"))  # True\nprint(isValid(\"(]\"))  # False\nprint(isValid(\"([)]\"))  # False\nprint(isValid(\"{[]}\"))  # True\nprint(isValid(\"(\")) # False\nprint(isValid(\")\")) # False\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of Key Parts:**\n\n* `stack = []`: Initializes an empty list to act as a stack.  Stacks use the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle.\n\n* `bracket_map`:  A dictionary efficiently maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets. This avoids multiple `if/elif/else` statements for comparisons.\n\n* `if char in bracket_map.values():`: Checks if the character is an opening bracket.\n\n* `if not stack or stack.pop() != bracket_map[char]:`: This crucial line performs two checks:\n    * `not stack`: Checks if the stack is empty. An empty stack during a closing bracket indicates an unmatched closing bracket.\n    * `stack.pop() != bracket_map[char]`: If the stack is not empty, it pops the top element (last opened bracket) and compares it to the expected opening bracket from `bracket_map`.  A mismatch indicates an invalid sequence.\n\n* `return not stack`: At the end, if the stack is empty (`not stack` evaluates to `True`), it means all open brackets have been matched and closed; otherwise, there are unmatched brackets, resulting in `False`.\n\n\nThis solution provides a clear, efficient, and Pythonic way to solve the Valid Parentheses problem.  The use of a stack and a dictionary significantly improves readability and performance compared to more verbose approaches.\n",
  "16": "The Python solution below uses a dummy node to simplify the merging process.  This avoids needing to handle special cases for the head of the merged list.\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef mergeTwoLists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merges two sorted linked lists into a single sorted linked list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1: The head of the first sorted linked list.\n        list2: The head of the second sorted linked list.\n\n    Returns:\n        The head of the merged sorted linked list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    dummy = ListNode()  # Dummy node to simplify head handling\n    tail = dummy\n\n    while list1 and list2:\n        if list1.val < list2.val:\n            tail.next = list1\n            list1 = list1.next\n        else:\n            tail.next = list2\n            list2 = list2.next\n        tail = tail.next\n\n    # Append remaining nodes from either list1 or list2\n    tail.next = list1 or list2\n\n    return dummy.next  # Return the head of the merged list (after the dummy node)\n\n\n#Example Usage\nlist1 = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(4)))\nlist2 = ListNode(1, ListNode(3, ListNode(4)))\n\nmerged_list = mergeTwoLists(list1, list2)\n\n#Print the merged list\nwhile merged_list:\n    print(merged_list.val, end=\" \")\n    merged_list = merged_list.next\n# Output: 1 1 2 3 4 4\n\nlist3 = ListNode(5)\nlist4 = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3)))\nmerged_list = mergeTwoLists(list3,list4)\nwhile merged_list:\n    print(merged_list.val, end=\" \")\n    merged_list = merged_list.next\n# Output: 1 2 3 5\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **ListNode Class:** Defines a node structure for the linked list, containing a value (`val`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`).\n\n2. **Dummy Node:** A `dummy` node is created. This simplifies the logic by always having a node to attach the first element to.  We don't need to handle the special case of the first node separately.\n\n3. **Iteration:** The `while` loop continues as long as both `list1` and `list2` have nodes.\n\n4. **Comparison and Appending:** Inside the loop, the values of the current nodes in `list1` and `list2` are compared. The smaller node is appended to the `tail` of the merged list, and the corresponding list's head pointer is advanced.\n\n5. **Handling Remaining Nodes:** After one of the lists is exhausted, the remaining nodes from the other list are appended to the `tail`.  The `tail.next = list1 or list2` line cleverly does this in one line; if `list1` is empty, it defaults to `list2`, and vice versa.\n\n6. **Returning the Head:** Finally, `dummy.next` is returned, which points to the actual head of the merged list (after skipping the dummy node).\n\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(m + n), where 'm' and 'n' are the lengths of the input lists, because each node is visited once. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.  The use of a dummy node significantly improves the readability and reduces the complexity of the code compared to solutions that handle the head node as a special case.\n",
  "17": "The \"Generate Parentheses\" problem requires generating all possible valid combinations of parentheses given a number `n`.  A valid combination means that every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')', and the closing parenthesis always appears after the opening parenthesis.\n\nHere's a Python solution using backtracking, along with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef generate_parenthesis(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The number of pairs of parentheses.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of strings, where each string is a valid combination of parentheses.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n\n    def backtrack(s='', left=0, right=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursive backtracking function.\n\n        Args:\n            s: The current string of parentheses.\n            left: The number of opening parentheses used.\n            right: The number of closing parentheses used.\n        \"\"\"\n        if len(s) == 2 * n:  # Base case: if we've used all parentheses\n            result.append(s)\n            return\n\n        if left < n:  # If we can add an opening parenthesis\n            backtrack(s + '(', left + 1, right)\n        if right < left:  # If we can add a closing parenthesis (must be less than opening)\n            backtrack(s + ')', left, right + 1)\n\n    backtrack()  # Start the backtracking process\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 3\nprint(generate_parenthesis(n))  # Output: ['((()))', '(()())', '(())()', '()(())', '()()()']\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`generate_parenthesis(n)`:** This is the main function that takes the number of parenthesis pairs `n` as input and returns a list of valid combinations.\n\n2. **`backtrack(s='', left=0, right=0)`:** This is a recursive helper function that does the core work.\n   - `s`: This string accumulates the parentheses combinations being built.  It starts empty.\n   - `left`: This keeps track of how many opening parentheses '(' have been used so far.\n   - `right`: This keeps track of how many closing parentheses ')' have been used so far.\n\n3. **Base Case:** `if len(s) == 2 * n:`  When the length of the string `s` becomes twice the number of pairs (`2n`), we've used all the parentheses.  We add this complete combination to the `result` list and return.\n\n4. **Recursive Steps:**\n   - `if left < n:`:  We can add an opening parenthesis only if we haven't used all the allowed opening parentheses (`left < n`).  We recursively call `backtrack` with an updated `s`, `left`, and `right`.\n   - `if right < left:`: We can add a closing parenthesis only if we have more opening parentheses than closing parentheses (`right < left`). This ensures that we maintain the well-formed condition (every opening parenthesis has a matching closing parenthesis later). We recursively call `backtrack` with the updated values.\n\n5. **Backtracking:** The recursive calls explore all possible combinations by adding either an opening or closing parenthesis at each step. If a choice leads to an invalid combination (e.g., more closing than opening parentheses), it's automatically pruned because the condition `right < left` won't be met.  This is the essence of backtracking: trying different options and reverting if they don't lead to a solution.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently generates all valid combinations using backtracking and avoids generating invalid combinations, resulting in a clean and optimized solution.  The time complexity is O(4^n / n^(3/2)), which is dominated by the number of valid combinations. The space complexity is O(4^n / n^(3/2)) as well, primarily due to storing the resulting combinations.\n",
  "18": "The \"Merge k Sorted Lists\" problem can be efficiently solved using a priority queue (heap) data structure.  Here's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef mergeKLists(lists):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merges k sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.\n\n    Args:\n        lists: A list of k sorted linked lists (ListNode objects).\n\n    Returns:\n        A ListNode representing the head of the merged sorted linked list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not lists:  # Handle empty input list\n        return None\n\n    heap = []\n    # Initialize the heap with the head nodes of all lists.

If so, it returns `None`.\n\n   - **Heap Initialization:** A min-heap `heap` is created using `heapq`.  We push tuples of the form `(val, index, node)` onto the heap. The `val` is used for comparison (smallest value at the top), the `index` helps track which list the node belongs to, and `node` is the actual `ListNode` object. This allows us to efficiently find the smallest node across all lists.\n\n   - **Dummy Node:** A dummy node (`dummy`) is created. This simplifies the process of building the merged list because we always have a node to append to, even at the beginning.\n\n   - **Iterative Merging:** The `while heap` loop continues as long as there are nodes in the heap.\n\n     - **Smallest Node Retrieval:** `heapq.heappop(heap)` retrieves the node with the smallest value from the heap.\n\n     - **Appending to Merged List:** The smallest node is appended to the merged list by setting `tail.next` to the retrieved node, and then updating `tail` to point to the newly added node.\n\n     - **Adding Next Node:** If the retrieved node has a `next` node (meaning the list from which it came isn't exhausted), the `next` node is added to the heap.\n\n   - **Return Value:** Finally, `dummy.next` is returned, which is the head of the merged sorted linked list (we skip the dummy node).\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes across all k lists, and k is the number of lists.  The heap operations (push and pop) take O(log k) time each.\n\n- **Space Complexity:** O(k) to store the heap.  The space used by the heap is proportional to the number of lists, as at most one node from each list can be in the heap at any given time.\n",
  "19": "The problem asks us to swap adjacent nodes in a linked list.  We can't modify the node's values, only the node pointers.  This requires careful manipulation of pointers.  Here's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef swapPairs(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:\n    \"\"\"\n    Swaps every two adjacent nodes in a linked list.\n\n    Args:\n        head: The head of the linked list.\n\n    Returns:\n        The head of the modified linked list with swapped pairs.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Handle empty list or list with one node\n    if not head or not head.next:\n        return head\n\n    # Create a dummy node to simplify handling the head\n    dummy = ListNode(0, head)\n    prev = dummy\n\n    while prev.next and prev.next.next:\n        # Nodes to be swapped\n        first = prev.next\n        second = prev.next.next\n\n        # Perform the swap\n        prev.next = second\n        first.next = second.next\n        second.next = first\n\n        # Move to the next pair\n        prev = first\n\n    return dummy.next\n\n\n#Example Usage\nhead = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(4))))\nswapped_head = swapPairs(head)\n\n# Print the swapped list\nwhile swapped_head:\n    print(swapped_head.val, end=\" \")\n    swapped_head = swapped_head.next #Output: 2 1 4 3 \n```\n\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **ListNode Class:**  This defines a simple node structure for the linked list.\n\n2. **swapPairs Function:**\n   - **Base Cases:** It handles the cases where the list is empty or has only one node (no swaps needed).\n   - **Dummy Node:** A dummy node (`dummy`) is created before the head. This simplifies the logic, especially for handling the head pointer during the first swap.  It avoids special casing the first swap.\n   - **Iteration:** The `while` loop iterates through the list, two nodes at a time.  The condition `prev.next and prev.next.next` ensures we have at least two nodes remaining to swap.\n   - **Pointer Manipulation:** Inside the loop:\n     - `first` and `second` point to the nodes to be swapped.\n     - The lines `prev.next = second`, `first.next = second.next`, and `second.next = first` perform the actual swap by carefully re-arranging the pointers.  Draw it out on paper to visualize this step!\n     - `prev` is updated to point to the `first` node (which is now after the `second` node), preparing for the next swap.\n   - **Return Value:** Finally, `dummy.next` is returned, which is the new head of the swapped list (the dummy node is discarded).\n\n**How the Swapping Works (Visual Example):**\n\nLet's say we have the list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4\n\n1. **Initially:** `prev` points to the dummy node, `first` is 1, and `second` is 2.\n2. **Swap:** The pointers are changed to make `prev` point to `second`(2), `first` point to the node after `second`(3), and `second` point to `first`(1). The list becomes: Dummy -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 4\n3. **Next Iteration:** `prev` now points to `first`(1), `first` is 3, and `second` is 4. The swap is performed similarly.\n\n\nThis approach is efficient because it iterates through the list only once, making its time complexity O(n), where n is the number of nodes. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the list's size.  The use of the dummy node simplifies the code and makes it easier to understand and less error-prone.\n",

This simplifies the handling of the head of the list, especially in the first reversal.\n   - **`group_prev`:** This pointer keeps track of the tail of the previously reversed group.  It's crucial for connecting the reversed groups.\n   - **Finding the kth Node:** The inner `for` loop iterates `k` times to find the `kth` node. If it reaches the end of the list before finding the `kth` node, it means there aren't enough nodes left for a full group, so the function returns.\n   - **Reversing the k Nodes:**  This part uses three pointers (`prev`, `curr`, `temp`) to reverse the links within the k-group. It's a standard linked list reversal algorithm.\n   - **Connecting the Groups:**  After reversing the k nodes, the `group_prev.next` (tail of the previous group) is connected to the new head (`prev`) of the reversed group, and the tail of the reversed group (`curr`) is connected to the next group (`next_group`).\n   - **Iteration:** The `while True` loop continues until the end of the list is reached. `group_prev` is updated to point to the tail of the current reversed group to prepare for the next iteration.\n\nThe code efficiently handles edge cases like an empty list, a list with fewer than `k` nodes, and a list with a number of nodes that is a multiple of `k`. The use of a dummy node and clear pointer manipulation makes the code concise and easy to understand.  The example usage demonstrates its functionality with various inputs.\n",

The solution leverages the sorted nature of the input to efficiently identify and remove duplicates.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicates from a sorted array in-place.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A sorted list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of unique elements in the array.

If it is, it returns 0 because there are no unique elements.\n\n2. **Initialize `k`:**  The variable `k` acts as a pointer to the next available position in the array to store a unique element. It's initialized to 1 because the first element (`nums[0]`) is always unique in a sorted array (unless the array is empty).\n\n3. **Iterate and Compare:** The code iterates through the array starting from the second element (`range(1, len(nums))`).  In each iteration, it compares the current element (`nums[i]`) with the previous element (`nums[i-1]`).\n\n4. **Identify Unique Elements:** If `nums[i]` is different from `nums[i-1]`, it means we've encountered a new unique element.\n\n5. **In-place Modification:** The unique element `nums[i]` is then placed at index `k` using `nums[k] = nums[i]`.  `k` is incremented to point to the next available position for the next unique element.\n\n6. **Return the Count:** After the loop completes, `k` holds the number of unique elements.  The function returns `k`.  The original `nums` array is modified in-place; the first `k` elements contain the unique elements in their original order.\n\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n) because we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) because we are performing the operation in-place and not using any extra space proportional to the input size.  It's an efficient and space-saving solution for removing duplicates from a sorted array.\n",
  "22": "The \"Remove Element\" problem can be efficiently solved in Python using a two-pointer approach.  This avoids the creation of a new array, operating directly on the input array `nums` in-place as required.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_element(nums, val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes all occurrences of val from nums in-place and returns the new length.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: The input integer array.\n        val: The integer value to remove.\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of elements in nums that are not equal to val.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Use two pointers: k (slow pointer) and i (fast pointer)\n    k = 0  # k points to the next position to place a non-val element\n\n    for i in range(len(nums)):  # i iterates through all elements\n        if nums[i] != val:\n            nums[k] = nums[i]  # Place the non-val element at position k\n            k += 1  # Move k forward to the next available position\n\n    return k  # k now represents the number of elements not equal to val\n\n#Example usage\nnums = [3,2,2,3]\nval = 3\nnew_length = remove_element(nums, val)\nprint(f\"The new array is: {nums[:new_length]} and its length is: {new_length}\") #Output: The new array is: [2, 2] and its length is: 2\n\nnums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]\nval = 2\nnew_length = remove_element(nums, val)\nprint(f\"The new array is: {nums[:new_length]} and its length is: {new_length}\") #Output: The new array is: [0, 1, 3, 0, 4] and its length is: 5\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `k` is initialized to 0. It acts as a pointer to the next available position in the array where we'll place an element that is *not* equal to `val`.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - The `for` loop iterates through each element of the `nums` array using index `i`.\n\n3. **Conditional Check:**\n   - Inside the loop, we check if `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`.\n\n4. **In-place Modification:**\n   - If `nums[i]` is not equal to `val`, it means we want to keep this element.  We then place it at the position indicated by `k` using `nums[k] = nums[i]`.  This overwrites elements equal to `val` with elements that are not equal to `val`.\n\n5. **Incrementing `k`:**\n   - After placing a non-`val` element, we increment `k` to move to the next available position.\n\n6. **Return Value:**\n   - After the loop finishes, `k` holds the number of elements in `nums` that are not equal to `val`. This is because `k` tracks the number of elements we've placed at the beginning of the array.  The elements from index `k` to the end of the array are not relevant (they might still contain `val`).  The function returns this value `k`.\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of `nums`, because we iterate through the array only once. The space complexity is O(1) because we are using only a few constant extra variables, regardless of the input array size. This makes it a highly efficient in-place solution for the problem.  It avoids the overhead of creating and copying new arrays.\n",
  "23": "The \"Implement strStr()\" problem is a classic string searching problem.  We can solve it efficiently using a few different approaches.  Here's a Python solution with explanations using the straightforward approach and the more optimized Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm.\n\n\n**Method 1:  Naive String Search (Brute Force)**\n\nThis approach iterates through the haystack and checks for a match with the needle at each position.\n\n```python\ndef strStr_brute_force(haystack, needle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first occurrence of needle in haystack using brute force.\n\n    Args:\n        haystack: The string to search within.\n        needle: The string to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        The index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    len_haystack = len(haystack)\n    len_needle = len(needle)\n\n    if len_needle == 0:  # Empty needle always matches at index 0\n        return 0\n\n    for i in range(len_haystack - len_needle + 1):\n        if haystack[i:i + len_needle] == needle:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n\n#Example Usage\nhaystack = \"hello\"\nneedle = \"ll\"\nprint(f\"Brute Force: Index of '{needle}' in '{haystack}' is: {strStr_brute_force(haystack, needle)}\") #Output: 2\n\nhaystack = \"aaaaa\"\nneedle = \"bba\"\nprint(f\"Brute Force: Index of '{needle}' in '{haystack}' is: {strStr_brute_force(haystack, needle)}\") #Output: -1\n\nhaystack = \"\"\nneedle = \"\"\nprint(f\"Brute Force: Index of '{needle}' in '{haystack}' is: {strStr_brute_force(haystack, needle)}\") #Output: 0\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handle Empty Needle:** If the needle is empty, it's considered a match at index 0.\n2. **Iterate Through Haystack:** The outer loop iterates through the haystack, checking each possible starting position for the needle.\n3. **Check for Match:** The inner (implicit) comparison `haystack[i:i + len_needle] == needle` checks if the substring of `haystack` starting at index `i` and with length `len_needle` matches the `needle`.\n4. **Return Index or -1:** If a match is found, the index `i` is returned.  If the loop completes without finding a match, -1 is returned.\n\n\n**Method 2: Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm (More Efficient)**\n\nThe KMP algorithm is significantly more efficient for larger strings than the brute-force approach. It avoids redundant comparisons by pre-processing the needle to create a \"partial match table.\"\n\n```python\ndef strStr_kmp(haystack, needle):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the first occurrence of needle in haystack using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        haystack: The string to search within.\n        needle: The string to search for.\n\n    Returns:\n        The index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if not found.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not needle:\n        return 0\n\n    m = len(needle)\n    n = len(haystack)\n\n    # Create partial match table (pi)\n    pi = [0] * m\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(1, m):\n        while j > 0 and needle[i] != needle[j]:\n            j = pi[j - 1]\n        if needle[i] == needle[j]:\n            j += 1\n        pi[i] = j\n\n\n    #Perform search using pi table\n    j = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        while j > 0 and haystack[i] != needle[j]:\n            j = pi[j - 1]\n        if haystack[i] == needle[j]:\n            j += 1\n        if j == m:\n            return i - m + 1\n\n    return -1\n\n#Example Usage (same as above, will produce identical output)\nhaystack = \"hello\"\nneedle = \"ll\"\nprint(f\"KMP: Index of '{needle}' in '{haystack}' is: {strStr_kmp(haystack, needle)}\") #Output: 2\n\nhaystack = \"aaaaa\"\nneedle = \"bba\"\nprint(f\"KMP: Index of '{needle}' in '{haystack}' is: {strStr_kmp(haystack, needle)}\") #Output: -1\n\nhaystack = \"\"\nneedle = \"\"\nprint(f\"KMP: Index of '{needle}' in '{haystack}' is: {strStr_kmp(haystack, needle)}\") #Output: 0\n```\n\n**Explanation of KMP:**\n\n1. **Partial Match Table (pi):**  The `pi` table stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the needle that is also a suffix.  This table allows the algorithm to avoid re-checking characters when a mismatch occurs.\n\n2. **Search:** The algorithm iterates through the haystack. When a mismatch happens, the `pi` table is used to shift the needle to a position where a potential match can continue, thus avoiding redundant comparisons.\n\n3. **Efficiency:** KMP has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the haystack, making it superior to the brute-force O(m*n) approach (where m is the length of the needle) for larger inputs.\n\n\nFor most cases, especially when dealing with relatively short needles, the brute-force method is sufficient.  However, for very large haystacks and needles, the KMP algorithm provides a significant performance improvement.  Choose the method best suited for your needs and input size considerations.\n",

This prevents potential floating-point errors.\n   - **Comparison:**\n     - `nums[mid] == target`: If the target is found at `mid`, the index `mid` is returned.\n     - `nums[mid] < target`: If the target is greater than the value at `mid`, it must be in the right half of the array.  `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.\n     - `nums[mid] > target`: If the target is smaller than the value at `mid`, it must be in the left half. `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.\n\n3. **Target Not Found:**\n   - If the loop completes without finding the target (`low > high`), the `low` variable will point to the correct insertion index. This is because the binary search process effectively narrows down the search space until `low` and `high` cross each other, with `low` indicating where the target should be inserted to maintain sorted order.\n\n4. **Return Value:** The function returns `low`, which is the index where the target is found or where it should be inserted.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(log n) due to the binary search.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space.  The algorithm operates in place.  This makes it very efficient for large arrays.\n",

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Check Rows:** It iterates through each row.  A set `seen` is used to track the numbers encountered in the current row. If a number (other than '.') is already in `seen`, it means there's a duplicate, and the function immediately returns `False`.\n\n2. **Check Columns:**  It iterates through each column (index `col`). For each column, it iterates through the rows, checking for duplicates in the same manner as the row check.\n\n3. **Check 3x3 Sub-boxes:**  It iterates through the 3x3 sub-boxes using nested loops with steps of 3 (`range(0, 9, 3)`).  For each sub-box, it uses a similar approach with a `seen` set to check for duplicates.\n\n4. **Return True:** If all checks pass without finding any duplicates, the function returns `True`, indicating a valid Sudoku board.\n\n\nThe use of sets makes the duplicate checking very efficient (O(1) on average for `add` and `in` operations). The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of cells in the board (81 in this case), because each cell is visited a constant number of times (once for rows, once for columns, and once for its 3x3 sub-box).  The space complexity is also O(n) due to the use of sets to store seen numbers.\n",
  "26": "The Count and Say problem requires generating a sequence where each term is a description of the previous term. Let's break down the solution with a Python implementation and detailed explanation:\n\n**Understanding the Sequence**\n\nThe sequence starts with \"1\".

This is the core of the recursive definition.\n\n3. **Initialization:** `result = \"\"`, `count = 1` - We initialize an empty string to store the result and a counter to track consecutive digit occurrences.\n\n4. **Iteration and Counting:** The `for` loop iterates through the previous term (`prev_term`).  Inside the loop:\n   - `if i + 1 < len(prev_term) and prev_term[i] == prev_term[i + 1]: count += 1` - This checks if the current digit is the same as the next. If so, the counter is incremented.\n   - `else: result += str(count) + prev_term[i]; count = 1` - If the current digit is different from the next (or it's the last digit), the count and the digit are appended to the `result` string, and the counter is reset.\n\n5. **Return Value:** `return result` - The function returns the generated string.\n\n\nThis recursive solution clearly demonstrates the count-and-say process.  While elegant, for very large values of `n`, it might lead to stack overflow errors due to the depth of recursion.  An iterative solution could be more efficient for such cases.\n",

We use `copy()` to avoid modifying the original list during backtracking.\n     - If `remaining < 0`, it means we've exceeded the target, so we backtrack.\n   - **Recursive Step:**\n     - It iterates through the `candidates` array starting from the `start` index.  The `start` index is crucial for allowing the same candidate to be used multiple times.\n     - For each candidate, it includes it in the `combination`, recursively calls `backtrack` with the updated `remaining` sum and the same `start` index (allowing repetition), and then removes the candidate using `pop()` to backtrack and explore other possibilities.\n\n**How Backtracking Works:**\n\nBacktracking is a depth-first search approach.  It explores all possible combinations by building a solution incrementally.  If a path leads to a solution (sum equals target), it's added to the result.  If a path is invalid (sum exceeds target), it backtracks by undoing the last choice and trying another. The use of `start` index in the recursive call is key to allowing repeated numbers in the solution.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the problem by avoiding redundant calculations through backtracking and using the `start` index cleverly to manage repeated number selection.  The use of a copy in the `result.append` ensures that modifications to the combination list during backtracking don't affect previously found solutions.\n",
  "28": "The Combination Sum II problem requires finding all unique combinations of numbers from a given list that sum up to a target value, with the constraint that each number can be used only once.  This solution uses backtracking to explore all possible combinations efficiently while avoiding duplicates.\n\n```python\ndef combinationSum2(candidates, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds all unique combinations of numbers in candidates that sum to target.\n\n    Args:\n        candidates: A list of integers.\n        target: The target sum.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists, where each inner list represents a unique combination.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n    candidates.sort()  # Sorting is crucial for duplicate avoidance\n\n    def backtrack(combination, remaining, start):\n        if remaining == 0:\n            result.append(combination.copy())  # Add a copy to avoid modification\n            return\n\n        if remaining < 0:\n            return\n\n        for i in range(start, len(candidates)):\n            # Skip duplicate numbers\n            if i > start and candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1]:\n                continue\n\n            # Include the current number\n            combination.append(candidates[i])\n            backtrack(combination, remaining - candidates[i], i + 1)  # i+1 to avoid reusing\n            combination.pop()  # Backtrack: remove the current number\n\n    backtrack([], target, 0)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\ncandidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5]\ntarget = 8\nprint(combinationSum2(candidates, target))  # Output: [[1, 1, 6], [1, 2, 5], [1, 7], [2, 6]]\n\ncandidates = [2,5,2,1,2]\ntarget = 5\nprint(combinationSum2(candidates, target))  # Output: [[1, 2, 2], [5]]\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Sorting:** The `candidates` list is sorted initially. This is crucial for efficiently skipping duplicate numbers during the backtracking process.  If we don't sort, we might generate duplicate combinations.\n\n2. **Backtracking Function (`backtrack`):**\n   - `combination`:  Keeps track of the current combination being built.\n   - `remaining`: The remaining sum needed to reach the target.\n   - `start`: The index from which to start considering numbers in the `candidates` list in the current recursive call. This prevents revisiting previously used numbers within a combination and ensures each number is used only once.\n\n3. **Base Cases:**\n   - If `remaining` is 0, a valid combination is found, so it's added to the `result`.\n   - If `remaining` is negative, the current path cannot lead to a solution, so the function returns.\n\n4. **Iteration and Recursive Calls:**\n   - The code iterates through the `candidates` list starting from the `start` index.\n   - **Duplicate Check:** `if i > start and candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1]: continue` This line efficiently handles duplicates. If we encounter a number that's the same as the previous one and we are not at the beginning of the list, we skip it because we've already considered combinations involving the previous instance of that number.\n   - The current number (`candidates[i]`) is added to the `combination`.\n   - A recursive call is made to `backtrack` with the updated `combination`, `remaining` (reduced by the current number), and `start` updated to `i + 1` to avoid reusing the current number in the same combination.\n   - **Backtracking:** After the recursive call, the last added number is removed from the `combination` using `combination.pop()`. This step is essential for exploring other possibilities.\n\n5. **Return Value:** The function returns the `result` list containing all the unique combinations that sum up to the target.\n\n\nThis solution is efficient because it avoids redundant computations by skipping duplicates and using backtracking to explore only necessary paths.  The time complexity is dominated by the backtracking, which can be exponential in the worst case, but it's significantly better than brute-force approaches that would generate many duplicate combinations. The space complexity is also dominated by the recursive call stack, which can also be exponential in the worst case.\n",
  "29": "The \"First Missing Positive\" problem asks us to find the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that is not present in the input array.  A naive approach would involve sorting and iterating, but we can achieve a more efficient solution using the array itself as a hash table.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef firstMissingPositive(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the smallest missing positive integer in an unsorted array.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: An unsorted list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The smallest missing positive integer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = len(nums)\n\n    # 1. Mark numbers (n+1) and smaller as negative if they exist\n    for i in range(n):\n        num = abs(nums[i])  # Handle negative numbers\n        if 1 <= num <= n:\n            nums[num - 1] = -abs(nums[num - 1])  # Mark as negative\n\n    # 2. Find the first positive number (index + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if nums[i] > 0:\n            return i + 1\n\n    # 3. If all numbers from 1 to n are present, the missing number is n+1\n    return n + 1\n\n\n# Example usage\nnums1 = [1, 2, 0]\nprint(f\"Smallest missing positive for {nums1}: {firstMissingPositive(nums1)}\")  # Output: 3\n\nnums2 = [3, 4, -1, 1]\nprint(f\"Smallest missing positive for {nums2}: {firstMissingPositive(nums2)}\")  # Output: 2\n\nnums3 = [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]\nprint(f\"Smallest missing positive for {nums3}: {firstMissingPositive(nums3)}\")  # Output: 1\n\nnums4 = [1,2,3]\nprint(f\"Smallest missing positive for {nums4}: {firstMissingPositive(nums4)}\") # Output: 4\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe solution leverages the property that the smallest missing positive integer must be within the range [1, n+1], where n is the length of the input array.  The algorithm consists of three steps:\n\n1. **Marking Numbers:** We iterate through the array.  If a number `num` is within the range [1, n], we use its absolute value to index into the array and mark the element at that index as negative. This acts as a hash table; the index represents the number, and a negative value indicates its presence.  Taking the absolute value handles cases where a number might already be marked negative from a previous iteration.\n\n2. **Finding the Missing Number:** We iterate again. The first index `i` where `nums[i]` is still positive indicates that the number `i + 1` is missing.\n\n3. **Handling the Case Where All Numbers are Present:** If all numbers from 1 to n are present in the array (all elements are negative after step 1), then the smallest missing positive integer is n + 1.\n\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n* **Time Complexity:** O(n), as we iterate through the array a constant number of times.\n* **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we modify the array in-place.  We don't use any extra space proportional to the input size.  This is a significant improvement over solutions that might use a separate hash set or sort the array.\n\n\nThis optimized approach provides a highly efficient solution to the \"First Missing Positive\" problem.  It's crucial to understand the use of the array as a hash table and the careful handling of negative numbers to appreciate its cleverness and efficiency.\n",
  "30": "The \"Trapping Rain Water\" problem involves finding the amount of water that can be trapped between bars of varying heights.  The water trapped at any index is determined by the minimum of the maximum height to its left and the maximum height to its right, minus the current height at that index.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation, using two approaches: a brute-force approach and a more efficient two-pointer approach.\n\n**Method 1: Brute Force (less efficient)**\n\n```python\ndef trap_brute_force(height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates trapped rainwater using a brute-force approach.\n\n    Args:\n        height: A list of non-negative integers representing the elevation map.\n\n    Returns:\n        The total amount of trapped rainwater.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(height)\n    total_water = 0\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        left_max = 0\n        right_max = 0\n\n        # Find maximum height to the left\n        for j in range(i + 1):\n            left_max = max(left_max, height[j])\n\n        # Find maximum height to the right\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            right_max = max(right_max, height[j])\n\n        # Calculate trapped water at current index\n        water_at_index = min(left_max, right_max) - height[i]\n        total_water += water_at_index if water_at_index > 0 else 0\n\n    return total_water\n\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of Brute Force:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** We initialize `total_water` to 0.  This variable will store the accumulated trapped water.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The outer loop iterates through each bar in the `height` list.\n\n3. **Finding Left and Right Maximums:** For each bar, two inner loops find the maximum height to its left and right.  This is computationally expensive, leading to O(n^2) time complexity.\n\n4. **Calculating Trapped Water:** The trapped water at the current index is calculated as `min(left_max, right_max) - height[i]`.  We only add positive values to `total_water` because negative values indicate no trapped water.\n\n5. **Return Value:** The function returns the `total_water`.\n\n\n**Method 2: Two-Pointer Approach (efficient)**\n\n```python\ndef trap_two_pointers(height):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates trapped rainwater using a two-pointer approach.\n\n    Args:\n        height: A list of non-negative integers representing the elevation map.\n\n    Returns:\n        The total amount of trapped rainwater.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(height)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n\n    left = 0\n    right = n - 1\n    left_max = 0\n    right_max = 0\n    total_water = 0\n\n    while left < right:\n        if height[left] < height[right]:\n            if height[left] >= left_max:\n                left_max = height[left]\n            else:\n                total_water += left_max - height[left]\n            left += 1\n        else:\n            if height[right] >= right_max:\n                right_max = height[right]\n            else:\n                total_water += right_max - height[right]\n            right -= 1\n\n    return total_water\n\n```\n\n**Explanation of Two-Pointer Approach:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**  We initialize `left`, `right`, `left_max`, `right_max`, and `total_water`.\n\n2. **Two Pointers:**  We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, starting at the beginning and end of the `height` list.\n\n3. **Iteration and Comparison:** The `while` loop continues as long as `left < right`.  In each iteration, we compare `height[left]` and `height[right]`.\n\n4. **Water Calculation:**  If `height[left] < height[right]`, we process the left pointer.  If the current height is greater than or equal to the current left maximum, we update the left maximum. Otherwise, we calculate the trapped water and add it to `total_water`.  The right pointer is handled similarly.\n\n5. **Pointer Movement:**  We increment `left` or decrement `right` depending on which pointer was processed.\n\n6. **Return Value:** The function returns the `total_water`.  This approach has a time complexity of O(n).\n\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nheight = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]\nprint(f\"Trapped water (Brute Force): {trap_brute_force(height)}\")  # Output: 6\nprint(f\"Trapped water (Two Pointers): {trap_two_pointers(height)}\")  # Output: 6\n```\n\nThe two-pointer approach is significantly more efficient for larger input sizes due to its linear time complexity compared to the brute-force approach's quadratic time complexity.  Therefore, the two-pointer method is the preferred solution.\n",
  "31": "The core idea behind solving this problem without using built-in big integer libraries is to simulate the manual multiplication process we learn in elementary school.

If so, the product is \"0\", and the function returns immediately.\n\n2. **Initialize Product Array:** A list `product` is created with the size `m + n` (where `m` and `n` are the lengths of `num1` and `num2` respectively).  This is because the maximum length of the product is the sum of the lengths of the input numbers.  It's initialized with zeros.\n\n3. **Nested Loops for Multiplication:** The code uses nested loops to iterate through each digit of `num1` and `num2`. The inner loop calculates the product of the current digits and adds it to the appropriate position in the `product` array, handling carries along the way.\n\n4. **Carry Handling:**  Integer division (`//`) is used to get the carry, and the modulo operator (`%`) gives the remaining digit.\n\n5. **Convert to String:** Finally, the `product` list is converted to a string using `\"\".join(map(str, product))`.  The `while` loop removes leading zeros from the result string.\n\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates manual multiplication, avoiding the need for built-in large integer libraries, and correctly handles potential carries and leading zeros.  It's crucial to understand the logic of manual multiplication to grasp how this code works.\n",
  "32": "The Jump Game II problem can be efficiently solved using a greedy approach.

Starts at 0.\n   - `current_reach`: The furthest index reachable with the current number of jumps. Starts at 0 (our initial position).\n   - `max_reach`: The furthest index reachable considering all jumps made so far.  Starts at 0.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - The code iterates through the `nums` array.\n   - `max_reach = max(max_reach, i + jump_length)`: In each iteration, it updates `max_reach` to the furthest index we can reach from the current position (`i`).\n\n3. **Jump Condition:**\n   - `if i == current_reach:`: This is the crucial part of the greedy strategy. If the current index `i` is equal to `current_reach`, it means we've reached the limit of our current jump. We need to make another jump.\n   - `jumps += 1`: Increments the jump counter.\n   - `current_reach = max_reach`: Updates `current_reach` to the new furthest reachable index.\n\n4. **Termination Condition:**\n   - `if current_reach >= n - 1:`: If we've reached or exceeded the last index, we've solved the problem. The loop breaks.\n\n5. **Return Value:**\n   - The function returns the final value of `jumps`.\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n\nThis greedy approach avoids exploring all possible jump combinations.  It maintains an optimal strategy by always extending its reach to the furthest possible point with the current number of jumps. This results in a time complexity of O(n) because we iterate through the array once.  The space complexity is O(1) because we use only a few constant extra variables.\n",
  "33": "The Permutations problem requires generating all possible orderings (permutations) of a given list of numbers.  We can solve this recursively or iteratively.

However,  an even more efficient approach uses sorting and a slightly modified backtracking algorithm.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef permuteUnique(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all unique permutations of a list containing potentially duplicate numbers.\n\n    Args:\n      nums: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n      A list of lists, where each inner list represents a unique permutation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    nums.sort() #Sorting is crucial for efficiency\n    result = []\n    n = len(nums)\n    used = [False] * n  #Keeps track of which numbers are currently used in the permutation\n\n    def backtrack(current_permutation):\n        if len(current_permutation) == n:\n            result.append(current_permutation.copy()) #Append a copy to avoid modification\n            return\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not used[i]:\n                #Skip duplicates to avoid redundant permutations\n                if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1] and not used[i - 1]:\n                    continue\n                used[i] = True\n                current_permutation.append(nums[i])\n                backtrack(current_permutation)\n                current_permutation.pop() #Backtrack: remove the last element\n                used[i] = False\n\n    backtrack([])\n    return result\n\n# Example Usage\nnums1 = [1,1,2]\nprint(f\"Unique permutations of {nums1}: {permuteUnique(nums1)}\")\n\nnums2 = [1,2,3]\nprint(f\"Unique permutations of {nums2}: {permuteUnique(nums2)}\")\n\nnums3 = [3,3,0,3]\nprint(f\"Unique permutations of {nums3}: {permuteUnique(nums3)}\")\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Sorting:** The `nums.sort()` line is crucial for efficiency.  Sorting allows us to easily skip duplicate numbers during the backtracking process.  This prevents generating redundant permutations.\n\n2. **Backtracking:** The `backtrack` function is the core of the algorithm. It recursively explores all possible permutations:\n   - **Base Case:** If the `current_permutation` has the same length as the input `nums`, a unique permutation is found, and a copy of it is added to the `result` list.  We use `copy()` to avoid modifying the original list.\n   - **Recursive Step:**  The outer loop iterates through each number in `nums`. The `if not used[i]` check ensures that each number is used only once in a given permutation. The crucial line `if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1] and not used[i - 1]: continue` skips duplicates.  If a number is the same as the previous one and the previous one hasn't been used yet, it's skipped to avoid generating redundant permutations.\n   - **Used Array:** The `used` array keeps track of which numbers are currently included in the `current_permutation`.  This is essential for ensuring that each number is used exactly once in each permutation.\n\n3. **Adding and Removing:**  The `current_permutation.append(nums[i])` line adds the current number to the permutation. `current_permutation.pop()` removes it after exploring all possible permutations with that number included (backtracking).\n\n4. **Return Value:** The function returns `result`, a list of lists containing all unique permutations.\n\n\nThis approach is significantly more efficient than generating all permutations and then filtering out duplicates, especially for larger input lists with many duplicates. The sorting and the conditional skip of duplicate numbers significantly reduce the search space.  Using the `used` array and backtracking ensures that all unique permutations are generated exactly once.\n",
  "35": "The most efficient way to rotate a square matrix in-place is by using a combination of transposing the matrix and then reversing each row.  Let's break down the Python solution and explanation:\n\n**Python Solution:**\n\n```python\ndef rotate_image(matrix):\n    \"\"\"\n    Rotates a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place.\n\n    Args:\n        matrix: A list of lists representing the square matrix.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(matrix)\n\n    # Transpose the matrix\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i, n):  # Only iterate through the upper triangle\n            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]\n\n    # Reverse each row\n    for i in range(n):\n        matrix[i].reverse()\n\n# Example usage:\nmatrix = [[1, 2, 3],\n          [4, 5, 6],\n          [7, 8, 9]]\n\nrotate_image(matrix)\nprint(matrix)  # Output: [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]\n\n\nmatrix2 = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]\nrotate_image(matrix2)\nprint(matrix2) # Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Transposing the Matrix:**  A transpose of a matrix swaps rows and columns.  Instead of iterating through the entire matrix twice (which would be less efficient), we only iterate through the upper triangle (elements where `j >= i`).  This is because swapping `matrix[i][j]` and `matrix[j][i]` also implicitly swaps the corresponding elements in the lower triangle.\n\n   - The line `matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]` performs a simultaneous swap using Python's tuple assignment, making the code concise and efficient.\n\n2. **Reversing Each Row:** After transposing, the matrix is a 90-degree counter-clockwise rotation of the original. To correct it to a 90-degree clockwise rotation, we need to reverse each row. The `matrix[i].reverse()` method efficiently reverses the elements within each row in-place.\n\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n\n- **In-place operation:**  The algorithm modifies the matrix directly without creating a new one, saving significant memory, especially for large matrices.\n- **Optimized iteration:**  Iterating only through the upper triangle of the matrix during transposition halves the number of iterations compared to iterating through the entire matrix.\n- **Built-in `reverse()` method:** Using the built-in `reverse()` method is faster than manually reversing using a loop or slicing.\n\nThis approach ensures both correctness and efficiency for rotating a square matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place.  Other approaches might exist but this is generally considered the most optimized and readable solution.\n",
  "36": "The core idea behind solving the Group Anagrams problem efficiently is to use the sorted form of each string as a key to group anagrams.  Since anagrams have the same letters, just arranged differently, their sorted forms will be identical.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef groupAnagrams(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Groups anagrams together from a list of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs: A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists, where each inner list contains strings that are anagrams of each other.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    anagram_groups = defaultdict(list)  # Use defaultdict for easy grouping\n\n    for string in strs:\n        sorted_string = \"\".join(sorted(string)) # Sort the string alphabetically\n        anagram_groups[sorted_string].append(string) #Append to list using sorted string as key\n\n    return list(anagram_groups.values()) #Return only the values (lists of anagrams)\n\n\n#Example Usage\nstrs = [\"eat\", \"tea\", \"tan\", \"ate\", \"nat\", \"bat\"]\nresult = groupAnagrams(strs)\nprint(result)  # Output: [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat'], ['bat']]\n\nstrs2 = [\"\"]\nresult2 = groupAnagrams(strs2)\nprint(result2) # Output: [[]]\n\nstrs3 = [\"a\"]\nresult3 = groupAnagrams(strs3)\nprint(result3) #Output: [['a']]\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Import `defaultdict`:** We import `defaultdict` from the `collections` module.  `defaultdict` is a subclass of `dict` that calls a factory function to supply missing values.  This is crucial for making our code concise and efficient.  We'll use it to automatically create lists for each unique sorted string (key).\n\n2. **Initialize `anagram_groups`:** We create a `defaultdict` where the keys are the sorted strings (representing anagram groups) and the values are lists of strings belonging to that anagram group.  The default factory is `list`, so if a key is missing, a new empty list is automatically created when you try to append to it.\n\n3. **Iterate and Sort:** The code iterates through each `string` in the input list `strs`.  For each string, it sorts the characters alphabetically using `sorted(string)` and then joins them back into a string using `\"\".join()`. This sorted string becomes our key.\n\n4. **Append to Group:**  The original `string` is appended to the list associated with its sorted string key in `anagram_groups`.  This automatically groups anagrams together because they will have the same sorted string key.\n\n5. **Return Groups:** Finally, `anagram_groups.values()` returns a view object containing all the lists of anagrams. We convert this to a list using `list()` to get the final result.\n\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n* **Time Complexity:** O(N * K * log K), where N is the number of strings and K is the maximum length of a string.  The dominant factor is sorting each string (O(K * log K)) which we do N times.\n\n* **Space Complexity:** O(N * K) in the worst case. This is because in the worst case, all strings could be anagrams of each other, resulting in one large list containing all strings.  The space used is proportional to the total number of characters in all strings.\n\n\nThis solution is efficient and leverages Python's built-in data structures and functions for a clear and concise implementation.  The use of `defaultdict` significantly simplifies the logic of grouping the anagrams.\n",
  "37": "The `pow(x, n)` problem can be solved efficiently using a recursive or iterative approach that leverages the property of exponents: x^(2k) = (x^k)^2.  This allows us to reduce the number of multiplications significantly, especially for large values of `n`.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef my_pow(x: float, n: int) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates x raised to the power n efficiently.\n\n    Args:\n        x: The base number.\n        n: The exponent.\n\n    Returns:\n        x raised to the power n.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1  # x^0 = 1\n    if n < 0:\n        x = 1 / x  # Handle negative exponents\n        n = -n\n\n    result = 1\n    while n > 0:\n        if n % 2 == 1:  # If n is odd\n            result *= x\n        x *= x  # Square x in each iteration\n        n //= 2  # Integer division by 2\n\n    return result\n\n#Example Usage\nprint(my_pow(2, 10))  # Output: 1024\nprint(my_pow(2.0, -2)) # Output: 0.25\nprint(my_pow(0, 10)) # Output: 0\nprint(my_pow(1,100)) # Output: 1\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Base Cases:**\n   - If `n` is 0, the result is 1 (x\u2070 = 1).\n   - If `n` is negative, we handle it by taking the reciprocal of `x` (1/x) and making `n` positive.  This is because x\u207b\u207f = 1 / x\u207f.\n\n2. **Iterative Approach:**\n   - We initialize `result` to 1. This will accumulate the final result.\n   - The `while n > 0` loop continues until the exponent `n` becomes 0.\n   - **Odd Exponent Handling:** If `n` is odd ( `n % 2 == 1`), it means we have an odd number of `x`'s to multiply.  We multiply the current `result` by `x`.\n   - **Squaring:** We square `x` (`x *= x`) in each iteration. This is the core optimization.  Instead of multiplying `x` repeatedly `n` times, we square it, effectively halving the number of multiplications needed.\n   - **Halving the Exponent:** We perform integer division (`n //= 2`) to reduce the exponent by half in each iteration.\n\n\n**Why this is efficient:**\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(log n).  The number of iterations is proportional to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. For example, calculating 2\u00b9\u2076 requires only 4 iterations (because 16 in binary is 10000).  A naive approach that repeatedly multiplies `x` by itself `n` times has a time complexity of O(n), which is significantly slower for large values of `n`.\n\n\nThis improved solution avoids the recursion depth limits that could be encountered with a purely recursive approach for very large exponents, making it more robust and efficient for a wider range of inputs.  It also directly handles negative exponents without needing extra function calls.\n",

It checks for conflicts in the same column and both diagonals.  The use of `zip` efficiently iterates through the diagonals.\n\n3. **`solve_util(row)`:** This is the recursive backtracking function:\n   - **Base Case:** If `row == n`, it means all queens have been placed successfully.  The current board configuration is added to the `solutions` list.\n   - **Recursive Step:** It iterates through each column in the current row. If `is_safe` returns `True`, it places a queen (`board[row][col] = 'Q'`), recursively calls `solve_util` for the next row, and then backtracks by removing the queen (`board[row][col] = '.'`).  Backtracking is crucial to explore all possible configurations.\n\n4. **Example Usage:** The code demonstrates how to use the `solve_nqueens` function and prints the solutions in a user-friendly format.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently handles the N-Queens problem using backtracking and clear, well-commented code.  The `is_safe` function is optimized to avoid redundant checks, making the algorithm reasonably fast for moderate values of `n`.  For very large `n`, more sophisticated optimization techniques might be necessary.\n",
  "39": "The N-Queens II problem requires finding the number of ways to place N queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.  A queen threatens any square in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nThis solution uses backtracking.  We explore possible placements of queens row by row.  For each row, we try placing a queen in each column.  If a placement is safe (doesn't threaten existing queens), we recursively explore the next row. If we reach the last row successfully, we've found a solution.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef total_nqueens(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Counts the number of distinct solutions to the N-Queens problem.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The size of the chessboard (n x n).\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of distinct solutions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def is_safe(row, col, placements):\n        \"\"\"Checks if it's safe to place a queen at (row, col).\"\"\"\n        for prev_row, prev_col in enumerate(placements):\n            # Check same column\n            if prev_col == col:\n                return False\n            # Check diagonals\n            if abs(prev_row - row) == abs(prev_col - col):\n                return False\n        return True\n\n    def solve_nqueens(row, placements):\n        \"\"\"Recursive backtracking function to find solutions.\"\"\"\n        if row == n:  # Base case: all queens placed successfully\n            return 1  # Found a solution\n\n        count = 0\n        for col in range(n):\n            if is_safe(row, col, placements):\n                placements[row] = col  # Place queen\n                count += solve_nqueens(row + 1, placements)  # Explore next row\n        return count\n\n    return solve_nqueens(0, [0] * n)  # Initialize placements\n\n\n# Example usage:\nn = 4\nsolutions = total_nqueens(n)\nprint(f\"The number of distinct solutions for {n}-queens is: {solutions}\")  # Output: 2\n\nn = 8\nsolutions = total_nqueens(n)\nprint(f\"The number of distinct solutions for {n}-queens is: {solutions}\")  # Output: 92\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`total_nqueens(n)`:** This is the main function. It initializes a list `placements` of size `n` with zeros.  These zeros represent the column index where a queen is placed in each row.  It then calls the recursive `solve_nqueens` function.\n\n2. **`is_safe(row, col, placements)`:** This function checks if placing a queen at `(row, col)` is safe given the existing queen placements. It iterates through the existing placements and checks for conflicts in the same column or diagonals.\n\n3. **`solve_nqueens(row, placements)`:** This is the core recursive backtracking function.\n   - **Base Case:** If `row == n`, it means all queens have been placed successfully, so it returns 1 (one solution found).\n   - **Recursive Step:** It iterates through each column (`col`) in the current row.  If placing a queen at `(row, col)` is safe (checked by `is_safe`), it places the queen (updates `placements`), and recursively calls itself for the next row (`row + 1`). The results of the recursive calls (number of solutions found from that placement) are summed up in `count`.\n   - Finally, it returns `count`, the total number of solutions found starting from that row.\n\nThe initial call to `solve_nqueens(0, [0] * n)` starts the backtracking process from the first row (row 0). The function explores all possible placements and counts the valid solutions.  The result is the total number of distinct solutions to the N-Queens problem.\n\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses backtracking to avoid exploring invalid placements early.  The `is_safe` function quickly determines whether a placement is valid, preventing unnecessary recursive calls.  The time complexity is still exponential, however, due to the nature of the problem.\n",
  "40": "The \"Maximum Subarray\" problem can be solved efficiently using Kadane's Algorithm.

It's initialized to 0 because the maximum sum could be 0 (e.g., for an array with all negative numbers).\n   - `max_ending_here`: This variable tracks the maximum sum ending at the current position. It's also initialized to 0.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - The code iterates through each element `x` in the input array `nums`.\n   - **Crucial Step:** `max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)`: This is the core of Kadane's algorithm.  It determines whether to extend the current subarray by adding the current element (`max_ending_here + x`) or to start a new subarray from the current element (0).  If `max_ending_here + x` becomes negative, it means extending the current subarray would reduce the sum, so we reset `max_ending_here` to 0, effectively starting a new subarray.\n   - `max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)`: This line updates `max_so_far` if a larger sum is found at the current position.\n\n3. **Return Value:**\n   - The function returns `max_so_far`, which holds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray found during the iteration.\n\n**Why Kadane's Algorithm is Efficient:**\n\nKadane's Algorithm avoids redundant calculations by only considering the maximum sum ending at each position.  Brute-force methods would repeatedly calculate sums for all possible subarrays, leading to a much higher time complexity.  Kadane's algorithm elegantly solves the problem in a single pass through the array.\n",

The modulo operator ensures it wraps around.\n\n3. **Return Value:** The function returns the `result` list containing all matrix elements in spiral order.  The empty list check at the beginning handles edge cases of empty input matrices.\n\n\nThis approach efficiently solves the Spiral Matrix problem with a clear and concise structure.  The use of boundary variables and a direction variable makes the logic easy to understand and maintain.  The time complexity is O(m*n) because each element is visited once, and the space complexity is O(m*n) in the worst case to store the result (although it could be O(1) if the output could be done in-place, which is not typical for this problem).\n",
  "42": "The Jump Game problem can be solved efficiently using a greedy approach.  We don't need to explore all possible paths; we only need to track the furthest reachable index.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef can_jump(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if it's possible to reach the last index of an array given jump lengths.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A list of integers representing maximum jump lengths at each index.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the last index is reachable, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = len(nums)\n    max_reach = 0  # The furthest index reachable so far\n\n    for i, jump in enumerate(nums):\n        # If we've already passed the current index, it's unreachable.\n        if i > max_reach:\n            return False\n\n        # Update the furthest reachable index.

This variable keeps track of the furthest index we can reach from our current position.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through the `nums` array using `enumerate` to get both the index (`i`) and the jump length (`jump`).\n\n3. **Unreachable Check:**  `if i > max_reach:` checks if the current index `i` is beyond the furthest reachable index `max_reach`. If it is, it means we cannot reach this index, and therefore we cannot reach the end, so we return `False`.\n\n4. **Update `max_reach`:** `max_reach = max(max_reach, i + jump)` updates `max_reach`.  We calculate the furthest reachable index from the current position (`i + jump`) and take the maximum of this and the current `max_reach`. This ensures we always have the furthest reachable index.\n\n5. **Goal Check:** `if max_reach >= n - 1:` checks if we've reached or surpassed the last index (`n - 1`). If we have, we've successfully reached the end, and we return `True`.\n\n6. **Return `False`:** If the loop completes without finding a path to the last index, it means we cannot reach the end, and the function returns `False`.\n\nThis greedy approach is efficient because it avoids exploring unnecessary paths.  It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array, and a space complexity of O(1) because it uses only a constant amount of extra space.\n",
  "43": "The Merge Intervals problem requires efficiently combining overlapping intervals.  A greedy approach, sorting the intervals by their start times, proves effective.\n\n**Python Solution:**\n\n```python\ndef merge_intervals(intervals):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merges overlapping intervals.\n\n    Args:\n      intervals: A list of lists, where each inner list represents an interval [start, end].\n\n    Returns:\n      A list of merged, non-overlapping intervals.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not intervals:  # Handle empty input\n        return []\n\n    # Sort intervals by start time\n    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    merged_intervals = [intervals[0]]  # Initialize with the first interval\n\n    for i in range(1, len(intervals)):\n        current_interval = intervals[i]\n        last_merged_interval = merged_intervals[-1]\n\n        # Check for overlap: If the current interval's start is less than or equal to the last merged interval's end\n        if current_interval[0] <= last_merged_interval[1]:\n            # Merge by updating the end of the last merged interval\n            merged_intervals[-1][1] = max(last_merged_interval[1], current_interval[1])\n        else:\n            # No overlap, add the current interval to the merged list\n            merged_intervals.append(current_interval)\n\n    return merged_intervals\n\n\n# Example usage:\nintervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]\nmerged = merge_intervals(intervals)\nprint(f\"Merged intervals: {merged}\")  # Output: Merged intervals: [[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]\n\nintervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]\nmerged = merge_intervals(intervals)\nprint(f\"Merged intervals: {merged}\")  # Output: Merged intervals: [[1, 5]]\n\nintervals = [[1,4],[0,4]]\nmerged = merge_intervals(intervals)\nprint(f\"Merged intervals: {merged}\") # Output: Merged intervals: [[0, 4]]\n\nintervals = []\nmerged = merge_intervals(intervals)\nprint(f\"Merged intervals: {merged}\") # Output: Merged intervals: []\n\nintervals = [[1,4],[0,0]]\nmerged = merge_intervals(intervals)\nprint(f\"Merged intervals: {merged}\") # Output: Merged intervals: [[0, 0], [1, 4]]\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handle Empty Input:** The function first checks if the `intervals` list is empty. If so, it returns an empty list.\n\n2. **Sort Intervals:** The intervals are sorted in ascending order based on their start times using `intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])`. This is crucial for the greedy approach to work correctly.  Sorting ensures we consider intervals in the order they appear on the timeline.\n\n3. **Initialize Merged Intervals:** The `merged_intervals` list is initialized with the first interval from the sorted list.\n\n4. **Iterate and Merge:** The code iterates through the remaining intervals. For each interval:\n   - It checks if there's an overlap with the last interval in `merged_intervals`. Overlap occurs if the current interval's start time is less than or equal to the end time of the last merged interval.\n   - If overlap exists, the intervals are merged by updating the end time of the last merged interval to the maximum of the two end times. This ensures the merged interval covers the entire range.\n   - If no overlap, the current interval is added as a new interval to `merged_intervals`.\n\n5. **Return Merged Intervals:** Finally, the function returns the `merged_intervals` list containing the merged, non-overlapping intervals.\n\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step (where n is the number of intervals). The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case (when no intervals overlap) because we might need to store all intervals in the `merged_intervals` list.  In the best case (all intervals overlap), the space complexity is O(1).\n",

All intervals encountered before this point do not overlap and are directly added to the `merged` list.\n\n2. **Merge overlapping intervals:** Once an interval overlapping with `newInterval` is found, the code enters a loop.  Inside the loop, it continuously updates the start and end of `newInterval` to encompass all overlapping intervals.  `min(newInterval[0], intervals[i][0])` finds the earliest start time, and `max(newInterval[1], intervals[i][1])` finds the latest end time.  This ensures the merged interval includes all overlapping ranges.\n\n3. **Add remaining intervals:** After the merging loop, the merged `newInterval` is added to `merged`. The code then adds any remaining intervals from the original `intervals` list to the `merged` list.\n\nThis approach ensures that all intervals are considered, overlapping intervals are merged correctly, and the resulting list remains sorted in ascending order by start time. The use of a `merged` list keeps the original `intervals` list unmodified, which is generally good practice.  The edge cases (empty intervals list, new interval completely contained within an existing interval, etc.) are handled correctly within the logic of the loops.\n",
  "45": "The problem asks for the length of the last word in a string.  We need to handle cases with multiple spaces, leading/trailing spaces, and potentially only spaces in the input string.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef length_of_last_word(s: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the length of the last word in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        The length of the last word.

The `split()` method, when called without any arguments, splits the string `s` into a list of words using whitespace as the delimiter.  Crucially, it automatically removes leading and trailing whitespace.  For example:\n\n   - `\"Hello World\"` becomes `['Hello', 'World']`\n   - `\" Hello World  \"` becomes `['Hello', 'World']`\n   - `\"   \"` becomes `[]` (an empty list)\n\n2. **`if not words:`:** This condition checks if the list `words` is empty.  If it's empty, it means the input string contained only whitespace or was empty, so we return 0.\n\n3. **`last_word = words[-1]`:**  This line extracts the last word from the `words` list using negative indexing. `words[-1]` accesses the last element of the list.\n\n4. **`return len(last_word)`:** Finally, we return the length of the `last_word` using the built-in `len()` function.\n\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nstring1 = \"Hello World\"\nstring2 = \"   fly me   to   the moon  \"\nstring3 = \"luffy is still joyboy\"\nstring4 = \"a \"\nstring5 = \"\"\n\n\nprint(f\"Length of last word in '{string1}': {length_of_last_word(string1)}\")  # Output: 5\nprint(f\"Length of last word in '{string2}': {length_of_last_word(string2)}\")  # Output: 4\nprint(f\"Length of last word in '{string3}': {length_of_last_word(string3)}\")  # Output: 6\nprint(f\"Length of last word in '{string4}': {length_of_last_word(string4)}\")  # Output: 1\nprint(f\"Length of last word in '{string5}': {length_of_last_word(string5)}\")  # Output: 0\n\n```\n\nThis solution is efficient and concise because it leverages Python's built-in string manipulation capabilities.  It handles edge cases gracefully and provides a clear, readable solution to the problem.  The time complexity is O(n) due to the `split()` operation (where n is the length of the string), and the space complexity is O(n) in the worst case (if the string has many words). However, in most cases, the space complexity will be much less than O(n).\n",
  "46": "The \"Plus One\" problem requires adding 1 to a large integer represented as an array of digits.  The challenge lies in handling potential carry-overs when adding 1 to the least significant digit.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef plus_one(digits):\n    \"\"\"\n    Increments a large integer represented as an array of digits by one.\n\n    Args:\n        digits: A list of integers representing the digits of the large integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of integers representing the incremented large integer.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    n = len(digits)\n    carry = 1  # Initialize carry to 1, as we're adding 1\n\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):  # Iterate from right to left\n        digits[i] += carry\n        carry = digits[i] // 10  # Integer division to get the carry\n        digits[i] %= 10  # Modulo operation to get the remainder (the digit)\n\n    if carry > 0:  # If there's still a carry after processing all digits\n        digits.insert(0, carry)  # Insert the carry as the most significant digit\n\n    return digits\n\n# Example Usage\ndigits1 = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(f\"Plus One of {digits1}: {plus_one(digits1)}\")  # Output: [1, 2, 4]\n\ndigits2 = [9, 9, 9]\nprint(f\"Plus One of {digits2}: {plus_one(digits2)}\")  # Output: [1, 0, 0, 0]\n\ndigits3 = [0]\nprint(f\"Plus One of {digits3}: {plus_one(digits3)}\") # Output: [1]\n\ndigits4 = [6,1,4,5,3,9,0,1,9,5,1,8,6,7,0,5,5,4,3]\nprint(f\"Plus One of {digits4}: {plus_one(digits4)}\") # Output: [6,1,4,5,3,9,0,1,9,5,1,8,6,7,0,5,5,4,4]\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** The `carry` variable is initialized to 1 because we are adding 1 to the integer.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through the `digits` array from right to left (least significant digit to most significant digit) using a `for` loop with a reversed range (`range(n - 1, -1, -1)`).\n\n3. **Adding and Carry Calculation:**  Inside the loop:\n   - `digits[i] += carry`:  The current digit is incremented by the carry.\n   - `carry = digits[i] // 10`: Integer division (`//`) is used to calculate the new carry. If the sum exceeds 9, the carry will be 1; otherwise, it will be 0.\n   - `digits[i] %= 10`: The modulo operator (`%`) gives the remainder after division by 10, which is the updated digit (0-9).\n\n4. **Handling Carry-over:** After the loop, if `carry` is still greater than 0, it means there's a carry-over from the most significant digit.  In this case, the `carry` is inserted at the beginning of the `digits` array using `digits.insert(0, carry)`.\n\n5. **Return Value:** The function returns the modified `digits` array, representing the incremented integer.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently handles all possible cases, including those where the input is all 9s, resulting in a new array with an additional digit (e.g., [9, 9, 9] becomes [1, 0, 0, 0]).  The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of digits, because we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) in most cases, but it can be O(n) in the worst case (when the input is all 9s and we need to add a new digit). However, in the context of the problem, this is still considered constant extra space as the added space is directly proportional to the input size in the worst case.\n",
  "47": "The problem \"Add Binary\" requires adding two binary strings as if they were numbers in base-2.  We can't directly use Python's built-in addition because it operates on decimal numbers.  Instead, we need to simulate binary addition using bitwise operations or a manual carry-over approach.  Here's a Python solution with a detailed explanation using the manual carry-over method, which is generally easier to understand:\n\n\n```python\ndef add_binary(a, b):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adds two binary strings and returns their sum as a binary string.\n\n    Args:\n      a: The first binary string.\n      b: The second binary string.\n\n    Returns:\n      The sum of a and b as a binary string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    max_len = max(len(a), len(b))\n    a = a.zfill(max_len)  # Pad with leading zeros to ensure equal length\n    b = b.zfill(max_len)\n\n    carry = 0\n    result = \"\"\n\n    for i in range(max_len - 1, -1, -1):\n        digit_a = int(a[i])\n        digit_b = int(b[i])\n\n        sum_digits = digit_a + digit_b + carry\n\n        result = str(sum_digits % 2) + result  # Get the least significant bit\n        carry = sum_digits // 2  # Calculate the carry for the next iteration\n\n    if carry:  #If there is a remaining carry after processing all digits.\n        result = \"1\" + result\n\n    return result\n\n#Example Usage\nprint(add_binary(\"11\", \"1\"))  # Output: 100\nprint(add_binary(\"1010\", \"1011\")) # Output: 10101\nprint(add_binary(\"111\", \"1\")) #Output: 1000\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Padding with Leading Zeros:** The code first finds the maximum length between the two input strings (`max_len`). Then, it uses the `zfill()` method to pad the shorter string with leading zeros. This ensures that both strings have the same length, making the subsequent iteration easier.\n\n2. **Iteration and Addition:** The code iterates through the strings from right to left (least significant bit to most significant bit).  In each iteration:\n   - It extracts the digits from `a` and `b` as integers.\n   - It calculates the `sum_digits`, including the carry from the previous iteration.\n   - `sum_digits % 2` gives the remainder (0 or 1), which is the least significant bit of the current sum. This bit is prepended to the `result` string.\n   - `sum_digits // 2` performs integer division, giving the carry-over for the next iteration.\n\n3. **Handling Final Carry:** After the loop, if `carry` is 1 (meaning there's a remaining carry from the most significant bit), a \"1\" is prepended to the `result` string.\n\n4. **Return Value:** The function returns the `result` string, which contains the binary sum.\n\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates binary addition without relying on any built-in functions that handle decimal arithmetic. The use of string manipulation and the iterative carry-over method provides a clear and understandable solution to the Add Binary problem.  The code is well-commented to further enhance understanding.\n",

If it is, the square root is 0, and the function immediately returns 0.\n\n2. **Binary Search Initialization:**  `low` is initialized to 1 (the smallest possible integer square root) and `high` is initialized to `x` (the largest possible integer square root).\n\n3. **Binary Search Iteration:** The `while` loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Inside the loop:\n   - `mid` is calculated as the middle point between `low` and `high` using integer division (`//`).\n   - **Check for Perfect Square:** If `mid * mid` equals `x`, we've found the exact square root, so `mid` is returned.\n   - **Adjust Search Space:** If `mid * mid` is less than `x`, the square root must be in the upper half of the search space, so `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.  If `mid * mid` is greater than `x`, the square root must be in the lower half, so `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.\n\n4. **Return Value:** If the loop completes without finding a perfect square, it means the square root is not an integer. In this case, `high` will hold the floor (integer part) of the square root, which is returned.\n\n\n**Why Binary Search is Efficient:**\n\nBinary search significantly reduces the search space in each iteration, making the algorithm very efficient.  The time complexity is O(log n), where n is the input number `x`.  This is a much better time complexity than a linear search (O(n)).  The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables.\n",
  "49": "The Climbing Stairs problem is a classic dynamic programming problem.  Let's break down the solution and then implement it in Python.\n\n**Understanding the Problem**\n\nThe core idea is that to reach step `n`, you must have come from either step `n-1` or step `n-2`.  The number of ways to reach step `n` is the sum of the number of ways to reach step `n-1` and the number of ways to reach step `n-2`.\n\n**Dynamic Programming Approach**\n\nWe can use dynamic programming to efficiently solve this. We'll create an array (or list in Python) `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the number of distinct ways to reach step `i`.\n\n* **Base Cases:**\n    * `dp[0] = 1` (There's one way to reach step 0: do nothing)\n    * `dp[1] = 1` (There's one way to reach step 1: take one step)\n\n* **Recursive Relation:**\n    * For `i >= 2`, `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`\n\n**Python Solution with Explanation**\n\n```python\ndef climbStairs(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of distinct ways to climb n stairs, taking 1 or 2 steps at a time.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The number of stairs.\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of distinct ways to climb the stairs.

We add 1 to include the 0th step in our calculations.\n6. **`dp[0] = 1` and `dp[1] = 1`**: Sets the base cases.\n7. **`for i in range(2, n + 1):`**: Iterates through the remaining steps from 2 to `n`.\n8. **`dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]`**: This line implements the recursive relation. It sums the number of ways to reach the previous two steps to get the number of ways to reach the current step.\n9. **`return dp[n]`**: Returns the value stored in `dp[n]`, which represents the total number of ways to reach the nth step.\n\n\nThis dynamic programming approach avoids redundant calculations and provides a highly efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n).  There are also more space-efficient solutions that use constant space, but this is the clearest and easiest to understand implementation of the DP method.\n",
  "50": "The problem involves simplifying a Unix-style file path.  This means handling redundant slashes, `.` (current directory) and `..` (parent directory) elements.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef simplify_path(path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simplifies a Unix-style file path.\n\n    Args:\n        path: The input path string.\n\n    Returns:\n        The simplified canonical path string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    stack = []  # Use a stack to efficiently manage directory traversal\n\n    # Split the path into components, handling multiple slashes\n    components = path.split('/')\n    for component in components:\n        if component == '' or component == '.':  # Ignore empty and current directory components\n            continue\n        elif component == '..':  # Handle parent directory traversal\n            if stack:  # Only pop if the stack is not empty (avoid going above root)\n                stack.pop()\n        else:\n            stack.append(component)\n\n    # Reconstruct the simplified path\n    simplified_path = '/' + '/'.join(stack)\n    return simplified_path\n\n\n# Example Usage\npath1 = \"/home//foo/../bar/./baz\"\npath2 = \"/a/./b/../../c/\"\npath3 = \"/../\"\npath4 = \"/a/b/c/../../d\"\npath5 = \"/\"\n\nprint(f\"'{path1}' simplified to: '{simplify_path(path1)}'\") # Output: /home/bar/baz\nprint(f\"'{path2}' simplified to: '{simplify_path(path2)}'\") # Output: /c\nprint(f\"'{path3}' simplified to: '{simplify_path(path3)}'\") # Output: /\nprint(f\"'{path4}' simplified to: '{simplify_path(path4)}'\") # Output: /d\nprint(f\"'{path5}' simplified to: '{simplify_path(path5)}'\") # Output: /\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** A stack `stack` is used to store directory components. Stacks are Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structures, perfectly suited for traversing directories.  If we encounter `..` we want to remove the *most recently* added directory.\n\n2. **Splitting the Path:** The input `path` is split into its constituent components using `path.split('/')`. This handles multiple consecutive slashes correctly.\n\n3. **Iterating through Components:** The code iterates through each component:\n   - **Empty or Current Directory:** If the component is empty (`''`) or represents the current directory (`.`), it's ignored.\n   - **Parent Directory:** If the component is `..`, it signifies moving up one directory level.  The `if stack:` check prevents attempting to pop from an empty stack (which would raise an error), ensuring we can't go \"above\" the root directory (`/`).\n   - **Other Directories:** Any other component is considered a regular directory and is pushed onto the `stack`.\n\n4. **Reconstructing the Path:** After processing all components, the `stack` contains the simplified directory structure. The simplified path is reconstructed by joining the components in the `stack` with `/` and prepending a leading `/`.\n\n5. **Return Value:** The function returns the `simplified_path` string.\n\nThis approach offers a clean and efficient solution to the \"Simplify Path\" problem, effectively handling various edge cases and producing the correct canonical path. The use of a stack makes the logic clear and avoids unnecessary complexities.\n",

This avoids extra space.\n\n2. **Handle First Row/Column Separately:** The first row and column are treated slightly differently because they are also used as markers.  `first_row_zero` and `first_col_zero` flags handle this.\n\n3. **Marking Phase:** We iterate through the matrix (excluding the first row and column). If an element is 0, we mark its corresponding row and column in the first row and first column.\n\n4. **Zeroing Phase:** We iterate through the first row and first column. If a marker is set (value is 0), we zero out the entire corresponding row or column.\n\n5. **Zero First Row/Column (If Necessary):** Finally, we zero out the first row and first column if their respective flags are set.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(m*n) (we iterate through the matrix twice) and a space complexity of O(1) (we use only a few constant extra variables).  It efficiently solves the \"Set Matrix Zeroes\" problem in-place.\n",

Similarly, `dp[0][j]` represents the edit distance between an empty string and the first `j` characters of `word2` (requiring `j` insertions).\n\n2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through the remaining cells of the `dp` table. For each cell `dp[i][j]`:\n   - If `word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`, it means the characters at the current positions match, so no operation is needed.  The value is copied from the diagonal (`dp[i-1][j-1]`).\n   - Otherwise, the minimum of three possibilities is chosen:\n     - `dp[i-1][j] + 1`: Delete `word1[i-1]` (one operation).\n     - `dp[i][j-1] + 1`: Insert `word2[j-1]` into `word1` (one operation).\n     - `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`: Replace `word1[i-1]` with `word2[j-1]` (one operation).\n\n3. **Result:** The final result is stored in `dp[m][n]`, which represents the minimum edit distance between the entire `word1` and `word2`.\n\nThis dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of O(m*n) and a space complexity of O(m*n), where 'm' and 'n' are the lengths of the input strings.

The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few variables to track indices.  This is significantly more efficient than a brute-force search which would have O(m * n) time complexity.\n",

We'll use pointers to track the boundaries of the 0s (red) and 2s (blue) sections within the array.

This places the 0 at its correct position. Then, we increment both `low` and `mid`.\n\n4. **Case 1 (White):** If `nums[mid]` is 1, it's already in its correct relative position (between 0s and 2s), so we just increment `mid`.\n\n5. **Case 2 (Blue):** If `nums[mid]` is 2, we swap it with the element at `high`.  This places the 2 at its correct position.  Then, we decrement `high`.  We don't increment `mid` here because the element swapped into the `mid` position could be a 0 or a 1, requiring further processing.\n\n6. **Termination:** The loop continues until `mid` surpasses `high`, guaranteeing that all elements are correctly sorted.\n\nThis two-pointer approach provides an in-place sorting solution with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it highly efficient.  It avoids the overhead of creating new arrays or using built-in sorting functions.\n",

Initialized to a large value.\n\n2. **Sliding Window:**\n   - The outer `while r < len(s)` loop expands the window to the right.\n   - `window_counts` is updated to reflect the new character added.\n   - If a character from `t` reaches its required frequency (`formed` increments), we check if the window contains all required characters.\n\n3. **Shrinking Window:**\n   - The inner `while l <= r and formed == required` loop shrinks the window from the left.\n   - The current window is compared with the minimum window found so far (`ans` is updated).\n   - The leftmost character is removed from `window_counts`. If it was a character from `t` and its count in the window drops below the required count, `formed` is decremented.\n\n4. **Return Value:**\n   - After processing the entire string, if `ans[0]` is still `float(\"inf\")`, it means no window containing all characters from `t` was found, so an empty string is returned. Otherwise, the substring corresponding to the minimum window is returned using string slicing.\n\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of strings s and t respectively,  and space complexity of O(k), where k is the number of unique characters in t (at most 26 for lowercase English alphabet).  This is efficient because it traverses each character of `s` at most twice (once in the expansion and once in the contraction of the window).\n",
  "56": "The \"Combinations\" problem requires generating all possible subsets of size k from a set of numbers 1 to n.  We can solve this efficiently using backtracking.\n\n**Python Solution:**\n\n```python\ndef combine(n: int, k: int) -> list[list[int]]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all combinations of k numbers from the range [1, n].\n\n    Args:\n        n: The upper limit of the range (inclusive).\n        k: The number of elements to choose in each combination.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists, where each inner list represents a combination.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    \n    def backtrack(combination, start):\n        # Base case: If the combination has k elements, add it to the result.\n        if len(combination) == k:\n            result.append(combination.copy())  # Important: copy to avoid modification\n            return\n\n        # Iterate through the remaining numbers\n        for i in range(start, n + 1):\n            combination.append(i)\n            backtrack(combination, i + 1)  # Recursive call with next number\n            combination.pop()  # Backtrack: remove the last added number\n\n    backtrack([], 1)  # Start backtracking with an empty combination and start index 1\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nn = 4\nk = 2\ncombinations = combine(n, k)\nprint(f\"All combinations of {k} numbers from 1 to {n}: {combinations}\")\n\n\nn = 10\nk = 3\ncombinations = combine(n,k)\nprint(f\"All combinations of {k} numbers from 1 to {n}: {combinations}\")\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **`combine(n, k)` function:** This is the main function that takes `n` and `k` as input and returns the list of combinations.\n\n2. **`backtrack(combination, start)` function:** This is a recursive helper function that does the core work of generating combinations using backtracking.\n\n   - **Base Case:** If the length of the `combination` list is equal to `k`, it means we've found a valid combination.  We create a copy of the `combination` list (using `.copy()`) and append it to the `result` list.  This is crucial because if we didn't copy, subsequent modifications to `combination` would affect the already added combinations. Then, the function returns.\n\n   - **Recursive Step:** The function iterates from `start` to `n`.  In each iteration:\n     - It adds the current number `i` to the `combination` list.\n     - It recursively calls `backtrack` with the updated `combination` and the next starting index (`i + 1`). This explores combinations including the current number.\n     - It removes the last added number (`combination.pop()`) This is the backtracking step.  It undoes the addition, allowing the function to explore other combinations without the current number.\n\n3. **Initial Call:** `backtrack([], 1)` starts the backtracking process with an empty `combination` list and a starting index of 1.\n\n**How Backtracking Works:**\n\nBacktracking is a systematic way to explore all possible solutions.  It works by building up a solution step-by-step.  If at any point the solution becomes invalid (e.g., we've chosen more than `k` numbers), or we've explored all possibilities from a given point, we backtrack\u2014we undo the last step and try a different path. This ensures that all possible valid combinations are explored.\n\nThe crucial element is the `combination.pop()` which allows the algorithm to explore all branches of the decision tree efficiently without redundant calculations.  The use of `.copy()` prevents unintended side effects from modifying the list after it is added to the result. This is important for the correctness of the algorithm.\n",
  "57": "The \"Subsets\" problem aims to find all possible combinations of elements from a given set, including the empty set.  This is equivalent to finding the power set of the input set.  We can solve this problem efficiently using iterative and recursive approaches.  Here's a Python solution with detailed explanations for both:\n\n**Method 1: Iterative Approach (Using Bit Manipulation)**\n\nThis approach leverages bit manipulation to generate all possible subsets efficiently.  Each bit in a binary number represents the inclusion or exclusion of an element from the original set.\n\n```python\ndef subsets_iterative(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all subsets of a given set using bit manipulation.\n\n    Args:\n      nums: A list of unique integers.\n\n    Returns:\n      A list of lists, where each inner list represents a subset.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums)\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1 << n):  # Iterate through all possible combinations (2^n)\n        subset = []\n        for j in range(n):\n            if (i >> j) & 1:  # Check if j-th bit is set in i\n                subset.append(nums[j])\n        result.append(subset)\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(f\"Subsets of {nums}: {subsets_iterative(nums)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`1 << n`:** This calculates 2 to the power of `n` (the number of elements in `nums`). This represents the total number of possible subsets.\n\n2. **Outer loop:** The outer loop iterates from 0 to 2<sup>n</sup> - 1.  Each number in this range can be represented as a binary number with `n` bits.\n\n3. **Inner loop:** The inner loop iterates through each bit of the binary representation of `i`.\n\n4. **`(i >> j) & 1`:** This checks if the `j`-th bit of `i` is set (1).  If it's set, it means the `j`-th element of `nums` is included in the current subset.  Right shift (`>>`) moves the bits to the right, and bitwise AND (`&`) checks if the least significant bit is 1.\n\n5. **`subset.append(nums[j])`:** If the bit is set, the element is added to the current subset.\n\n6. **`result.append(subset)`:** The complete subset is added to the result list.\n\n\n**Method 2: Recursive Approach (Backtracking)**\n\nThis approach uses recursion to explore all possible combinations systematically.\n\n```python\ndef subsets_recursive(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all subsets of a given set using recursion (backtracking).\n\n    Args:\n      nums: A list of unique integers.\n\n    Returns:\n      A list of lists, where each inner list represents a subset.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n\n    def backtrack(index, current_subset):\n        result.append(current_subset.copy())  # Add a copy to avoid modification\n\n        for i in range(index, len(nums)):\n            current_subset.append(nums[i])\n            backtrack(i + 1, current_subset)  # Explore including the element\n            current_subset.pop()  # Backtrack: exclude the element\n\n    backtrack(0, [])\n    return result\n\n# Example Usage\nnums = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(f\"Subsets of {nums}: {subsets_recursive(nums)}\")\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`backtrack(index, current_subset)`:** This recursive function explores all possible subsets.\n\n2. **`result.append(current_subset.copy())`:**  A copy of the current subset is added to the result.  This is crucial because we modify `current_subset` in place during recursion. Without the copy, only the final subset would be stored multiple times.\n\n3. **`for i in range(index, len(nums))`:** This loop iterates through the remaining elements in `nums`, starting from `index`.\n\n4. **`current_subset.append(nums[i])`:** The current element is added to the subset.\n\n5. **`backtrack(i + 1, current_subset)`:** The recursive call explores subsets including the current element.  `i + 1` ensures that we don't consider the same element twice.\n\n6. **`current_subset.pop()`:** After the recursive call returns, the last added element is removed (backtracking). This allows the exploration of subsets without that element.\n\n\nBoth methods achieve the same result. The iterative method is generally more efficient for larger input sets due to the overhead of recursive function calls, while the recursive method might be easier to understand for some. Choose the method that best suits your understanding and performance needs.\n",
  "58": "The Word Search problem requires a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible paths in the grid.

It iterates through each cell of the board, calling the `dfs` function for each cell as a potential starting point.\n\n2. **`dfs(row, col, index)` function:** This recursive function performs the depth-first search.\n\n   - **Base Cases:**\n     - If `index` reaches the end of the `word`, it means the word is found, so it returns `True`.\n     - If the current cell is out of bounds, or the character at the current cell doesn't match the character at the current `index` in the `word`, it returns `False`.\n\n   - **Marking Visited:** The crucial step `board[row][col] = '#'` marks the current cell as visited to prevent cycles and using the same cell multiple times.  This is crucial for the algorithm's correctness.\n\n   - **Recursive Exploration:** It recursively calls itself for the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).  The `or` condition ensures that if the word is found in any of the adjacent cells, it returns `True`.\n\n   - **Backtracking:** After exploring all adjacent cells, `board[row][col] = temp` restores the original character in the cell. This backtracking step is essential for exploring other paths correctly.  Without it, the search would not be able to explore alternative paths properly.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently explores all possible paths using DFS and backtracking to ensure correctness. The time complexity is O(M*N*4^L), where M and N are the dimensions of the board and L is the length of the word. The space complexity is O(L) due to the recursive call stack.\n",
  "59": "The problem asks us to remove duplicate nodes from a sorted linked list, ensuring the resulting list remains sorted. We can achieve this efficiently by iterating through the linked list and comparing each node's value to the next.\n\n**Python Solution:**\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef deleteDuplicates(head):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicates from a sorted linked list.\n\n    Args:\n        head: The head of the sorted linked list.\n\n    Returns:\n        The head of the linked list with duplicates removed.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not head:  # Handle empty list case\n        return head\n\n    current = head\n    while current.next:  # Iterate until the second to last node\n        if current.val == current.next.val:\n            current.next = current.next.next  # Skip the duplicate node\n        else:\n            current = current.next  # Move to the next node\n\n    return head\n\n\n# Example usage:\nhead = ListNode(1, ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(3, ListNode(4))))))\n\n#Print the original linked list\nprint_list(head)\n\nnew_head = deleteDuplicates(head)\n\n#Print the linked list after removing duplicates\nprint_list(new_head)\n\ndef print_list(head):\n    current = head\n    while current:\n        print(current.val, end=\" \")\n        current = current.next\n    print()\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **`ListNode` Class:** This class defines a node in the linked list, storing its value (`val`) and a pointer to the next node (`next`).\n\n2. **`deleteDuplicates(head)` Function:**\n   - **Base Case:** It first checks if the list is empty (`if not head`). If so, it returns the empty list.\n   - **Iteration:** It uses a `while` loop to iterate through the linked list.  The loop continues as long as `current.next` is not `None` (meaning there's a node after the current one).\n   - **Duplicate Check:** Inside the loop, it compares the value of the current node (`current.val`) with the value of the next node (`current.next.val`).\n   - **Duplicate Removal:** If the values are equal (a duplicate is found), it updates `current.next` to skip the duplicate node.  The line `current.next = current.next.next` effectively removes the duplicate node by linking the current node directly to the node after the duplicate.\n   - **Advancement:** If the values are not equal (no duplicate), it moves the `current` pointer to the next node (`current = current.next`).\n   - **Return Value:** Finally, it returns the `head` of the modified linked list.\n\n3. **Example Usage:**  The example code creates a sample sorted linked list with duplicates and then calls `deleteDuplicates` to remove them. The `print_list` function is added to help visualize the list before and after removing duplicates.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We iterate through the list once.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use only a constant amount of extra space.  We are modifying the list in place.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently removes duplicates while preserving the sorted order of the linked list.  It's a concise and optimized approach to solving the problem.\n",
  "60": "The problem requires removing duplicate nodes from a sorted linked list, leaving only unique nodes.  A sorted list simplifies the process because duplicates will be adjacent.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef deleteDuplicates(head):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicate nodes from a sorted linked list.\n\n    Args:\n        head: The head of the sorted linked list.\n\n    Returns:\n        The head of the linked list with duplicates removed.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not head:  # Handle empty list case\n        return head\n\n    dummy = ListNode(0, head)  # Create a dummy node to simplify handling the head\n    prev = dummy\n    curr = head\n\n    while curr:\n        if curr.next and curr.val == curr.next.val:  # Check for duplicates\n            while curr.next and curr.val == curr.next.val:\n                curr = curr.next  # Skip over all duplicate nodes\n            prev.next = curr.next  # Remove the duplicates by linking prev to the next unique node\n        else:\n            prev = curr  # Move prev forward if no duplicates found\n            \n        curr = curr.next #Always move curr forward\n\n    return dummy.next  # Return the head of the modified list (after dummy node)\n\n\n#Example usage\nhead = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(3, ListNode(3,ListNode(4,ListNode(4,ListNode(5)))))))))\n\nnew_head = deleteDuplicates(head)\n\n#Print the list\nwhile new_head:\n    print(new_head.val, end=\" \")\n    new_head = new_head.next\n#Output: 1 2 3 4 5\n\nhead = ListNode(1,ListNode(1,ListNode(1,ListNode(2,ListNode(3)))))\nnew_head = deleteDuplicates(head)\nwhile new_head:\n    print(new_head.val, end=\" \")\n    new_head = new_head.next\n#Output: 2 3\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handle Empty List:** The function first checks if the list is empty. If so, it returns `head` (which is None).\n\n2. **Dummy Node:** A dummy node is created. This simplifies the logic, especially for handling the case where the first node is a duplicate.  The dummy node points to the original `head`.\n\n3. **Iteration:** The `while curr` loop iterates through the list. `prev` always points to the node *before* `curr`.\n\n4. **Duplicate Check:** Inside the loop, it checks if `curr` has a next node and if the value of `curr` is equal to the value of its next node (`curr.next`). This indicates a duplicate.\n\n5. **Skip Duplicates:** If duplicates are found, an inner `while` loop skips over *all* consecutive duplicate nodes, updating `curr` until a unique node is encountered.\n\n6. **Remove Duplicates:** After skipping duplicates, `prev.next` is set to `curr.next`. This effectively removes the duplicate nodes from the linked list by changing the `next` pointer of the node before the duplicates to skip over them.\n\n7. **Move Pointers:** If no duplicates are found, `prev` is moved forward to `curr`.  `curr` is always moved forward to the next node.\n\n8. **Return Head:** Finally, `dummy.next` is returned.  This is the head of the modified list (excluding the dummy node).\n\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(N) because it iterates through the list once.

This is done by comparing `nums[left]` and `nums[mid]`. If `nums[left] <= nums[mid]`, the left half is sorted; otherwise, the right half is sorted.\n\n6. **Binary Search within Sorted Half:** Based on which half is sorted, the algorithm checks if the target falls within the range of that sorted half.  If it does, the search space is narrowed accordingly (`left` or `right` is updated). Otherwise, the search continues in the other half.\n\n7. **Target Not Found:** If the loop completes without finding the target, it means the target is not present in the array, and -1 is returned.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(log n) because we are effectively halving the search space in each iteration of the binary search.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1) because we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

Instead of stopping when they find *a* match, they continue searching in the left (for `find_first`) or right (for `find_last`) subarray to find the extreme occurrences.\n\n2. **Binary Search Modification:** The key difference is how the `left` and `right` pointers are updated after finding a match:\n   - `find_first`: `right = mid - 1` to search the left subarray for an earlier occurrence.\n   - `find_last`: `left = mid + 1` to search the right subarray for a later occurrence.\n\n3. **Main Function `find_first_and_last(nums, target)`:** This function calls the helper functions to get the first and last positions and returns them as a list.  It also handles the case where the target is not found.\n\nThe overall time complexity remains O(log n) because each binary search takes logarithmic time.  The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

  "63": "The key to solving this problem efficiently is to adapt binary search to handle the duplicates.  Standard binary search relies on the monotonicity of one half of the array.

In a standard binary search, we'd know which half is sorted based on the comparison `nums[left] < nums[mid]`. However, when duplicates exist, this comparison becomes unreliable.  For example, if `nums = [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2]`, and `left` and `mid` point to `2`, we can't determine if the left or right half is sorted based on this comparison alone.\n\nTherefore, when `nums[left] == nums[mid]`, we simply increment `left`. This effectively skips over the duplicate values at the beginning of the array.  This is safe because if the target is among these duplicates, we will encounter it eventually.  If it isn't, this step ensures we progress towards the potentially sorted part of the array.\n\nThe rest of the algorithm follows the standard binary search pattern, utilizing the comparison `nums[left] < nums[mid]` to determine which half is sorted and consequently, where to search next.\n\n\nThis solution maintains the logarithmic time complexity O(log n) in the average case and  O(n) in the worst case (when many duplicates exist).  The space complexity is O(1) because we are using only a constant amount of extra space.\n",
  "64": "The problem asks us to remove duplicates from a sorted array while ensuring each unique element appears at most twice.  We'll achieve this in-place, modifying the original array directly and returning the new length.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef removeDuplicates(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes duplicates from a sorted array, keeping at most two occurrences of each element.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A sorted list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of elements in the modified array (in-place).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not nums:  # Handle empty input\n        return 0\n\n    k = 0  # Index to track the end of the unique elements array\n    count = {} # Dictionary to keep track of element counts\n\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] not in count:\n            count[nums[i]] = 0\n        count[nums[i]] += 1\n\n        if count[nums[i]] <= 2:  # Keep at most two occurrences\n            nums[k] = nums[i]\n            k += 1\n\n    return k\n\n# Example usage:\nnums1 = [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]\nlen1 = removeDuplicates(nums1)\nprint(f\"Modified array: {nums1[:len1]}, Length: {len1}\")  # Output: Modified array: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3], Length: 5\n\nnums2 = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]\nlen2 = removeDuplicates(nums2)\nprint(f\"Modified array: {nums2[:len2]}, Length: {len2}\") # Output: Modified array: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3], Length: 7\n\nnums3 = []\nlen3 = removeDuplicates(nums3)\nprint(f\"Modified array: {nums3[:len3]}, Length: {len3}\") # Output: Modified array: [], Length: 0\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handle Empty Input:** The code first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns 0 immediately.\n\n2. **Initialization:**\n   - `k`: This variable keeps track of the index where the next unique (or up to two occurrences of the same) element should be placed.  It essentially represents the \"length\" of the modified array.\n   - `count`: This dictionary stores the count of each element encountered so far.  This helps us efficiently determine whether we've already seen two instances of a particular number.\n\n3. **Iteration:** The code iterates through the input array `nums`.\n\n4. **Counting and Placement:** For each element:\n   - It updates the count of the element in the `count` dictionary.\n   - If the count of the element is less than or equal to 2, it means we can still add this element to the modified part of the array.  It copies the element from its original position (`nums[i]`) to the `k`-th position (`nums[k]`) and increments `k`.\n\n5. **Return Value:** Finally, the function returns `k`, which represents the number of elements in the modified array (the number of elements up to the index `k-1`).\n\n**In-place Modification:** The code modifies the original `nums` array directly by overwriting elements after the index `k-1`.  This fulfills the \"in-place\" requirement of the problem.  Only the portion of the array from index 0 up to `k-1` contains the valid, deduplicated elements.  The rest of the array might contain leftover values, but they're ignored because the returned length is `k`.\n\n\nThis solution is efficient because it iterates through the array only once, making its time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The space complexity is O(1) if we exclude the space usage of the input array (since in Python, dictionaries use hash tables which have amortized constant time for insertion, search, and deletion. The space used is only proportional to the number of distinct elements which in the worst case is close to n). If the space used by the input is considered the space complexity becomes O(n).\n",

This stack will maintain bars that are potentially part of the largest rectangle.\n\n2. **Iteration with Sentinel:** We iterate through the `heights` array, appending a 0 at the end (`heights + [0]`). This sentinel value ensures that all remaining bars in the stack are processed at the end of the loop.\n\n3. **Stack Processing:** Inside the loop, we check if the stack is not empty and the height of the current bar (`h`) is less than or equal to the height of the bar at the top of the stack (`heights[stack[-1]]`).  This condition signifies that we've encountered a bar that could potentially form a larger rectangle with previous bars.\n\n4. **Calculating Area:** If the condition in step 3 is true, we pop the index from the stack.  We calculate the `height` of the rectangle (using the popped index) and the `width`. The width is determined by the difference between the current index `i` and the index of the bar just below the top of the stack (or 0 if the stack is empty).  We then update `max_area` if necessary.\n\n5. **Pushing Indices:** After the inner `while` loop (or if the condition wasn't met), we push the current bar's index `i` onto the stack.  This maintains the ascending order of bar heights in the stack.\n\n6. **Sentinel Handling:** The appended 0 at the end forces the processing of all remaining bars in the stack, ensuring that all potential rectangles are considered.\n\n7. **Return `max_area`:** Finally, the function returns the `max_area` found during the iteration.\n\n\nThis algorithm efficiently identifies the largest rectangle by intelligently using the stack to track potential rectangle candidates and avoid redundant calculations.  The use of the sentinel value ensures that all possible rectangles are considered.  The overall time complexity is O(n) because each element is pushed and popped at most once from the stack.\n",

The `max_area` variable stores the maximum area found so far.\n\n2. **Iterating through rows:** The outer loop iterates through each row of the matrix.\n\n3. **Updating `heights`:** The inner loop updates the `heights` array based on the current row. If a '1' is encountered, the height of that column is incremented; otherwise, it's reset to 0.\n\n4. **Stack-based approach:**  This is the core of the algorithm.  The stack maintains indices of the `heights` array.  It's used to efficiently find the maximum rectangular area for each column's height.\n\n   - The stack stores indices such that `heights[stack[i]] <= heights[stack[i+1]]`. This ensures that when we find a smaller height, we can calculate the area of rectangles formed by the previously larger heights.\n\n   - When a smaller height is encountered ( `heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]` ),  it means a rectangle is completed. We pop elements from the stack until this condition is no longer true.  For each popped element, we calculate the area (`height * width`) and update `max_area`. The `width` is calculated based on the difference of indices on the stack.\n\n5. **Handling remaining stack elements:** After processing all columns, there might be remaining elements in the stack.  These represent rectangles that extend to the end of the matrix.  The code handles them accordingly.\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(rows * cols) because it iterates through the matrix once and the stack operations take linear time in the worst case.

This simplifies the logic for handling the beginning of each sub-list, avoiding special cases.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The `while current` loop iterates through the original linked list.\n\n3. **Conditional Append:**  For each node, we check if its value is less than `x`. If it is, we append it to the `less_than` list (`less_tail.next = current`). Otherwise, we append it to the `greater_than_or_equal_to` list.  The tail pointers (`less_tail` and `greater_equal_tail`) are updated to point to the last added node.\n\n4. **Connecting Sub-lists:** After iterating through the entire original list, we connect the two sub-lists by setting `less_tail.next` to the head of the `greater_than_or_equal_to` list (`greater_equal_head.next`).  We set `greater_equal_tail.next` to `None` to terminate the second list correctly.\n\n5. **Return Value:** The function returns `less_head.next`, which is the head of the newly partitioned linked list (excluding the dummy node).\n\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list, because we iterate through the list once. The space complexity is O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.  The use of dummy nodes improves the code's readability and reduces the need for special handling of edge cases.\n",

We also perform a quick check to see if the character counts in `s1` and `s2` are the same; if not, they cannot be scrambles.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table:** A 3D array `dp` stores Boolean values. `dp[i][j][k]` is `True` if the substring `s1[i:i+k]` is a scramble of `s2[j:j+k]`, otherwise `False`.\n\n3. **Iteration:** The code iterates through substring lengths (`k`), then through possible starting indices (`i`, `j`) of substrings of length `k`.\n\n4. **Splitting and Checking:** For each substring pair, it checks all possible ways to split it into two non-empty substrings (`l` is the length of the first substring). It then recursively checks if the corresponding sub-substrings are scrambles using the `dp` table.  If any split yields a scramble, `dp[i][j][k]` is set to `True`.\n\n5. **Result:** Finally, `dp[0][0][n]` indicates whether the entire `s1` is a scramble of `s2`.\n\nThis dynamic programming approach avoids redundant computations by storing and reusing results, making it significantly more efficient than a purely recursive approach, especially for longer strings.  The time complexity is O(n^4), and space complexity is O(n^3).\n",

This is crucial for in-place merging.\n\n3. **Handling Remaining Elements:**\n   - After one of the arrays is exhausted, there might be remaining elements in the other array.\n   - The `while p2 >= 0:` loop handles the case where `nums2` still has elements left. These are directly copied to the beginning of `nums1`.  A similar loop could be added for the case where `nums1` has remaining elements (although it's not strictly necessary in this problem's definition, as `nums1` is guaranteed to have enough space).\n\n4. **In-place Operation:** The algorithm modifies `nums1` directly without creating a new array, fulfilling the requirement of the problem.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(m + n).  The while loops iterate through all elements of `nums1` and `nums2` once.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (for the pointers).  It operates in-place.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently merges the two sorted arrays while adhering to the constraints of the problem.  The use of pointers and merging from the end avoids unnecessary copying and shifting of elements, leading to an optimal time complexity.\n",
  "70": "The Gray code is a binary numeral system where two consecutive numbers differ in only one bit.  There are several ways to generate a Gray code sequence.

This essentially adds a '1' to the most significant bit of each number in the first half.\n   - Finally, we concatenate `gray_code_n` and `reflected_gray_code` to form the complete `n-bit` Gray code.\n\n**How it works (example with n=3):**\n\n1. `gray_code(2)` is called recursively, which returns `[0, 1, 3, 2]`.\n2. `previous_gray_code` becomes `[0, 1, 3, 2]`.\n3. `reflected_gray_code` becomes `[2, 3, 1, 0]`.\n4. `gray_code_n` becomes `[4, 5, 7, 6]` (adding 4 to each element of `previous_gray_code`).\n5. The final `gray_code(3)` is `[4, 5, 7, 6, 2, 3, 1, 0]`.  Note that this is a valid Gray code sequence.  Other valid sequences exist, as the problem states \"any valid\" sequence will do.\n\n\nThis recursive approach efficiently generates the Gray code sequence.  The time complexity is O(2<sup>n</sup>) because it generates all 2<sup>n</sup> codewords, and the space complexity is also O(2<sup>n</sup>) due to storing the sequence.  Other iterative approaches exist but are slightly more complex to understand.\n",
  "71": "The \"Subsets II\" problem requires generating all unique subsets of a given array, even if the array contains duplicate elements.  A naive approach of generating all subsets and then removing duplicates is inefficient.  A more optimized approach involves using backtracking and carefully handling duplicates to avoid generating redundant subsets.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef subsetsWithDup(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all unique subsets of a given array with potential duplicates.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists, where each inner list represents a unique subset.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n    nums.sort()  # Sorting is crucial for efficient duplicate handling\n\n    def backtrack(index, subset):\n        # Base case: We've reached the end of the array\n        if index == len(nums):\n            result.append(subset.copy())  # Add a copy to avoid modification\n            return\n\n        # Include the current element\n        subset.append(nums[index])\n        backtrack(index + 1, subset)\n\n        # Exclude the current element\n        subset.pop()\n\n        # Skip duplicate elements to avoid redundant subsets\n        while index + 1 < len(nums) and nums[index] == nums[index + 1]:\n            index += 1\n        backtrack(index + 1, subset)\n\n    backtrack(0, [])\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nnums1 = [1, 2, 2]\nprint(subsetsWithDup(nums1))  # Output: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2], [2, 2]]\n\nnums2 = [0]\nprint(subsetsWithDup(nums2))  # Output: [[], [0]]\n\nnums3 = [4, 4, 4, 1, 4]\nprint(subsetsWithDup(nums3)) # Output: [[], [1], [1, 4], [1, 4, 4], [1, 4, 4, 4], [1, 4, 4, 4, 4], [4], [4, 4], [4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4]]\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Sorting:** The input array `nums` is sorted. This is crucial because it allows us to easily identify and skip duplicate elements during the backtracking process.  Skipping duplicates ensures we don't generate redundant subsets.\n\n2. **Backtracking:** The `backtrack` function implements a recursive backtracking algorithm.\n\n3. **Base Case:** When the `index` reaches the end of the array, it means we've explored all possible combinations for the current subset.  A copy of the `subset` is appended to the `result` to ensure that modifications in subsequent recursive calls don't affect previously added subsets.\n\n4. **Include/Exclude:** For each element, the algorithm explores two possibilities:\n   - **Include:** Add the element to the `subset` and recursively call `backtrack` with the updated `subset` and the next index.\n   - **Exclude:**  Remove the last added element (which was added in the \"Include\" step) from the `subset` and recursively call `backtrack`.\n\n5. **Duplicate Handling:** The `while` loop efficiently skips over consecutive duplicate elements.  This is the key to avoiding redundant subsets. If the current element is the same as the next, we increment the index until we encounter a different element or reach the end of the array. This ensures that only one instance of the duplicate sequence is considered.\n\n6. **Return Value:** The function returns the `result` list, which contains all unique subsets.\n\n\nThis optimized backtracking approach ensures that the solution has a time complexity of O(N * 2^N) in the worst case (where N is the length of the input array), which is significantly better than the naive approach which might have a higher time complexity due to duplicate removal. The space complexity is O(N * 2^N) to store all the subsets.\n",

For each position `i`, it considers two possibilities:\n\n   - **Single Digit:**  The current digit `s[i-1]` can be decoded independently if it's between 1 and 9.  The number of ways to decode up to this point is the sum of the ways to decode up to the previous digit (`dp[i-1]`).\n\n   - **Two-Digit Combination:**  The digits `s[i-2:i]` (two consecutive digits) can form a two-digit number.  If this number is between 10 and 26, it can be decoded as a single letter. The number of ways to decode up to this point is the sum of the ways to decode up to two digits before (`dp[i-2]`).\n\n4. **Final Result:** `dp[n]` (where `n` is the length of the string) contains the total number of ways to decode the entire string.\n\n\nThis dynamic programming approach avoids redundant calculations and provides an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(n).  The space complexity could be further reduced to O(1) by using only three variables instead of the whole `dp` array to store the previous two results.\n",

The `prev` pointer iterates to find the node *before* the sublist to be reversed.\n\n3. **Reverse the Sublist:** The core logic uses three pointers:\n   - `cur`: The current node being processed in the sublist.\n   - `prev`: The node before the current node in the sublist (initially the node before the sublist).\n   - `next_node`: Temporarily stores the next node to avoid losing it during the reversal.\n\n   The loop iterates `right - left + 1` times to reverse the correct number of nodes.  The crucial steps are reversing the `cur` node's next pointer and updating `prev` to point to the newly reversed node.\n\n\n4. **Reconnect the Sublist:** After the reversal, `tail.next` (the tail of the reversed sublist) is connected to `next_node` (the rest of the list).\n\n5. **Return the Head:** The function returns the head of the modified list (which is `dummy.next` because of the dummy node).\n\n\nThis approach is efficient because it iterates through the list only twice (once to find the sublist and once to reverse it).  It avoids creating new nodes, making it space-efficient as well.  The use of a dummy node greatly simplifies the code, especially for handling the head of the list.\n",

It's added to `result`.\n   - **Base Case 2:** If `index` goes beyond the string length or `current_ip` already has more than 4 segments, it's an invalid state, so the function returns.\n   - **Iteration:** It iterates through possible segment lengths (1 to 3) from the current `index`.\n   - **Segment Validation:** It checks if the extracted `segment` is valid (not starting with '0' unless it's a single '0', and not exceeding 255).\n   - **Recursive Call:** If the segment is valid, it recursively calls `backtrack` with the updated `index` (the end of the current segment) and `current_ip` (appended with the valid segment).\n\nThe function efficiently explores all possibilities by recursively building IP addresses segment by segment, ensuring that each segment is valid according to the problem's constraints.  The use of a list `current_ip` within the `backtrack` function allows for easy manipulation and concatenation of the IP address segments during the recursive calls. Finally, the `\".\"join(current_ip)` part efficiently converts the list of segments into a properly formatted IP address string.\n",
  "75": "The inorder traversal of a binary tree visits nodes in the order: left subtree, root, right subtree.  This results in a sorted sequence if the tree is a binary search tree.\n\nHere are three Python solutions with explanations:\n\n**1. Recursive Approach:**\n\nThis is the most straightforward and conceptually simple solution.\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef inorderTraversalRecursive(root):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs an inorder traversal of a binary tree recursively.\n\n    Args:\n        root: The root node of the binary tree.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing the inorder traversal of the tree's nodes.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    if root:\n        result.extend(inorderTraversalRecursive(root.left))  # Traverse left subtree\n        result.append(root.val)                             # Visit the root\n        result.extend(inorderTraversalRecursive(root.right)) # Traverse right subtree\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.right = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right.left = TreeNode(3)\nprint(inorderTraversalRecursive(root))  # Output: [1, 3, 2]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe function `inorderTraversalRecursive` uses recursion.  It checks if the root is not `None`. If it's not `None`, it recursively calls itself on the left subtree, then appends the root's value, and finally recursively calls itself on the right subtree.  The results are accumulated in the `result` list.  The base case for the recursion is when `root` is `None`, in which case an empty list is returned.\n\n\n**2. Iterative Approach using Stack:**\n\nThis approach avoids recursion, using a stack to simulate the recursive calls.\n\n```python\ndef inorderTraversalIterative(root):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs an inorder traversal of a binary tree iteratively using a stack.\n\n    Args:\n        root: The root node of the binary tree.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing the inorder traversal of the tree's nodes.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    stack = []\n    current = root\n    while current or stack:\n        while current:\n            stack.append(current)\n            current = current.left\n        current = stack.pop()\n        result.append(current.val)\n        current = current.right\n    return result\n\n# Example usage (same tree as before):\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.right = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right.left = TreeNode(3)\nprint(inorderTraversalIterative(root))  # Output: [1, 3, 2]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe iterative approach uses a stack to keep track of nodes to visit.  The `while` loop continues as long as there's a current node or the stack is not empty.  The inner `while` loop pushes all left children onto the stack until a leaf node is reached. Then, the top node is popped from the stack, its value is added to the result, and the process continues with its right child.\n\n\n**3. Morris Traversal (In-place, no stack or recursion):**\n\nThis approach is the most efficient in terms of space complexity, as it doesn't use recursion or a stack.  It uses the concept of threading the tree.\n\n```python\ndef inorderTraversalMorris(root):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs an inorder traversal of a binary tree using Morris traversal (in-place).\n\n    Args:\n        root: The root node of the binary tree.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing the inorder traversal of the tree's nodes.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    current = root\n    while current:\n        if current.left is None:\n            result.append(current.val)\n            current = current.right\n        else:\n            predecessor = current.left\n            while predecessor.right and predecessor.right != current:\n                predecessor = predecessor.right\n            if predecessor.right is None:\n                predecessor.right = current\n                current = current.left\n            else:\n                predecessor.right = None\n                result.append(current.val)\n                current = current.right\n    return result\n\n# Example usage (same tree as before):\nroot = TreeNode(1)\nroot.right = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right.left = TreeNode(3)\nprint(inorderTraversalMorris(root))  # Output: [1, 3, 2]\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nMorris traversal cleverly uses the right child pointer to create links to the predecessor.  It avoids recursion and stack by using the tree structure itself.  If a node has a left subtree, it finds the rightmost node in the left subtree (predecessor) and links it to the current node.  Then, it traverses the left subtree. Once the left subtree is traversed, the link is removed, and the current node's value is added to the result.  This is a bit more complex to understand but offers the best space complexity (O(1)).\n\n\nAll three methods achieve the same result, but the choice depends on the trade-off between readability and efficiency.  The recursive approach is easiest to understand, the iterative approach is more efficient in terms of space for deep trees than recursion, and the Morris traversal is the most space-efficient overall. Remember to handle the `None` case for the root to avoid errors.\n",
  "76": "The problem asks us to generate all structurally unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs) with nodes containing values from 1 to `n`.  A BST is a tree where the value of each node is greater than all values in its left subtree and smaller than all values in its right subtree.\n\nThe solution uses dynamic programming and recursion. We build a table `dp` where `dp[i]` stores all possible BSTs with `i` nodes.  For a given number of nodes `n`, we iterate through all possible root values (1 to n). For each root value `i`, we recursively generate the left subtree (using nodes 1 to `i-1`) and the right subtree (using nodes `i+1` to `n`).  We then combine these subtrees with the root `i` to create a new BST.\n\nHere's the Python code with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef generateTrees(n: int) -> list[TreeNode]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all structurally unique BSTs with n nodes.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The number of nodes in the BST.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of TreeNode objects, representing all unique BSTs.

For each `i` (number of nodes), it iterates through all possible root node values (1 to `i`).\n   - **Recursive Calls:**  It recursively calls `generateTrees` to get all possible left and right subtrees.\n   - **Combination:** It combines each possible left subtree with each possible right subtree, creating a new BST with the current root value.\n   - **Return Value:** Finally, it returns `dp[n]`, which contains all unique BSTs with `n` nodes.\n\n3. **`print_tree(node)` function (optional):** A helper function for visualizing the generated BSTs.\n\n\nThe dynamic programming approach avoids redundant calculations by storing and reusing previously computed results (the BSTs for smaller numbers of nodes). This significantly improves efficiency compared to a purely recursive solution.  The time complexity is O(4^n / n^(3/2)), which is derived from the Catalan numbers, and the space complexity is O(4^n / n^(3/2)) to store all generated trees. Remember that the number of unique BSTs grows exponentially with n.\n",
  "77": "The problem of counting unique Binary Search Trees (BSTs) can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming.  The core idea is that for a given number of nodes `n`, we can choose any node from 1 to `n` as the root.  Once we choose a root, the nodes smaller than the root form the left subtree, and the nodes larger than the root form the right subtree. The number of unique BSTs with `n` nodes is the sum of the number of BSTs that can be formed by choosing each node as the root.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef numTrees(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the number of structurally unique BSTs with n nodes.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The number of nodes in the BST.\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of structurally unique BSTs.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a DP table to store the number of BSTs for each number of nodes.\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n    # Base cases:\n    # 0 nodes -> 1 way (empty tree)\n    # 1 node -> 1 way\n    dp[0] = 1\n    dp[1] = 1\n\n    # Iterate through the number of nodes from 2 to n.\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        # For each number of nodes i, consider each node as the root.\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            # The number of BSTs with i nodes and j as the root is:\n            #  (number of BSTs with j-1 nodes in the left subtree) *\n            #  (number of BSTs with i-j nodes in the right subtree)\n            dp[i] += dp[j - 1] * dp[i - j]\n\n    return dp[n]\n\n#Example Usage\nn = 3\nresult = numTrees(n)\nprint(f\"The number of unique BSTs with {n} nodes is: {result}\") # Output: 5\n\nn = 5\nresult = numTrees(n)\nprint(f\"The number of unique BSTs with {n} nodes is: {result}\") # Output: 42\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **DP Table:** We use a dynamic programming table `dp` of size `n+1`. `dp[i]` stores the number of unique BSTs with `i` nodes.\n\n2. **Base Cases:**  If `n` is 0 (no nodes), there's one way (the empty tree), so `dp[0] = 1`. If `n` is 1, there's also one way (a single node).\n\n3. **Iteration:** The core logic is in the nested loops.  The outer loop iterates through the number of nodes from 2 to `n`. The inner loop iterates through possible root node values (from 1 to `i`).\n\n4. **Recursive Relation:** For each `i` and `j`, `dp[j-1]` represents the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with the nodes from 1 to `j-1` (left subtree), and `dp[i-j]` represents the number of unique BSTs that can be formed with the nodes from `j+1` to `i` (right subtree).  Multiplying these two gives the number of BSTs with `j` as the root.  We sum up these possibilities for all possible root nodes `j` to get the total number of BSTs for `i` nodes.\n\n5. **Return Value:** Finally, `dp[n]` contains the total number of unique BSTs with `n` nodes, which is returned.\n\nThis dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(n) due to the DP table.  It's significantly more efficient than a naive recursive approach which would suffer from exponential time complexity due to repeated calculations.\n",

It calls the recursive helper function `helper` with the root node and initial bounds of negative and positive infinity.\n\n3. **`helper(node, lower_bound, upper_bound)` Function:** This recursive function does the core work:\n   - **Base Case:** If the current `node` is `None` (empty subtree), it's a valid BST, so it returns `True`.\n   - **Bounds Check:** It checks if the current node's value (`node.val`) is within the specified `lower_bound` and `upper_bound`. If not, it's not a valid BST, and it returns `False`.\n   - **Recursive Calls:** It recursively calls itself for the left and right subtrees.  Crucially, it updates the bounds for these recursive calls:\n     - For the left subtree, the upper bound becomes the current node's value (`node.val`).\n     - For the right subtree, the lower bound becomes the current node's value (`node.val`).\n   - **Logical AND:** The function uses `and` to ensure both the left and right subtrees are valid BSTs.  If either subtree is invalid, the entire subtree rooted at the current node is invalid.\n\n\nThis approach is efficient because it avoids unnecessary traversals.  It efficiently checks the BST property at each node by comparing it to its bounds, making it a significantly faster and cleaner solution than other methods which might involve sorting or in-order traversal.  The time complexity is O(N) where N is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once. The space complexity is O(H) in the worst case, where H is the height of the tree (due to the recursive call stack). In a balanced tree, H is log(N), and in a skewed tree, H is N.\n",

It's initialized with negative infinity to handle the first node correctly.\n   - It uses a nested function `inorder(node)` to perform an inorder traversal.\n\n3. **`inorder(node)` Function:** This function performs an inorder traversal recursively.\n   - `nonlocal first, second, prev`:  This declaration is crucial.  It explicitly states that the `first`, `second`, and `prev` variables being modified are the ones declared in the outer function's scope, not creating new local variables.\n   - It checks if `prev.val > node.val`. If true, it means the BST property is violated.\n   - If `first` is `None`, it means this is the first violation, so we assign `prev` to `first`.\n   - Otherwise, it assigns the current node (`node`) to `second`, as it's the second violation.\n   - `prev` is updated to the current node (`node`) for the next comparison.\n\n4. **Swapping Values:** After the inorder traversal, `first` and `second` hold the swapped nodes. Their values are swapped using simultaneous assignment (`first.val, second.val = second.val, first.val`).\n\n5. **Return Value:** The function returns the root of the recovered BST. The structure of the tree remains unchanged; only the values of two nodes are swapped.\n\n6. **Example Usage and Verification:** The code includes examples to demonstrate the function's usage and verifies the correctness of the recovery by performing an inorder traversal of the recovered tree \u2013 the output should be a sorted sequence.\n\n\nThis solution adheres to the O(n) time complexity (due to inorder traversal) and O(1) space complexity (only constant extra space is used for variables). Remember that this solution assumes exactly two nodes are swapped.  If more nodes are swapped, a more complex approach would be needed.\n",

Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to create `TreeNode` objects and use the `isSameTree` function to compare different tree structures.  The output clearly shows whether the trees are considered the same according to the problem's definition.  The added examples handle the cases where one or both trees are empty.\n",

It handles the base case of an empty tree (which is considered symmetric) and then calls the `isMirror` function to compare the left and right subtrees of the root.\n\n3. **`isMirror(left, right)` function:** This recursive function is the core of the solution. It compares two subtrees to see if they are mirror images:\n   - **Base Cases:**\n     - If both `left` and `right` are `None` (empty subtrees), they are mirror images.\n     - If only one of `left` or `right` is `None`, they are not mirror images.\n     - If the values (`val`) of `left` and `right` are different, they are not mirror images.\n   - **Recursive Step:** If none of the base cases are met, it recursively calls `isMirror` to compare the left subtree's left child with the right subtree's right child, and the left subtree's right child with the right subtree's left child.  The `and` operator ensures that both comparisons must be true for the subtrees to be mirror images.\n\n\n**Iterative Solution (using a queue):**\n\nWhile recursion is often elegant for tree traversals, an iterative approach using a queue can be more efficient for very deep trees to avoid stack overflow errors.  However, the recursive solution is generally more readable.\n\n(An iterative solution using a queue would be significantly longer and less intuitive than the recursive approach for this problem.  Therefore, it's omitted for brevity, but you can find numerous examples online if you prefer an iterative solution).\n\n\nThe recursive solution provides a clear and concise way to solve the Symmetric Tree problem.  Remember to handle the base cases properly for correct functionality.\n",

Each node has a value (`val`), a left child (`left`), and a right child (`right`).\n\n2. **`maxDepth(root)` Function:** This function implements the recursive DFS algorithm.\n\n   - **Base Case:** If the `root` is `None` (empty tree), it returns 0 because an empty tree has a depth of 0.\n\n   - **Recursive Step:**\n     - It recursively calls `maxDepth` on the left subtree (`root.left`) to get its depth (`left_depth`).\n     - It recursively calls `maxDepth` on the right subtree (`root.right`) to get its depth (`right_depth`).\n     - The maximum depth of the entire tree is then calculated as `max(left_depth, right_depth) + 1`.  The `+1` accounts for the current node itself.\n\n3. **Example Usage:** The example code creates a sample binary tree and then calls `maxDepth` to find its maximum depth.  It also demonstrates the handling of an empty tree.\n\n**Why DFS is efficient here:**\n\nDFS is a natural fit for traversing tree structures because it explores one branch as deeply as possible before backtracking. This approach directly finds the longest path from the root to a leaf node, which is exactly what we need to determine the maximum depth.  BFS would also work but would require more memory to store nodes at each level.  For this problem, DFS (recursive implementation) is generally simpler and more concise.\n",
  "86": "The problem of constructing a binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversals leverages the unique properties of these traversals.  Preorder traversal follows the pattern `(root, left subtree, right subtree)`, while inorder traversal is `(left subtree, root, right subtree)`.

If either is empty, it returns `None`, indicating an empty tree.\n\n2. **Root Node:** The first element of the `preorder` list is always the root of the tree.  We extract it and find its index in the `inorder` list.  This index is crucial because it separates the left and right subtrees in the `inorder` traversal.\n\n3. **Recursive Calls:** We then recursively call `buildTree` to construct the left and right subtrees.  The crucial step is slicing the `preorder` and `inorder` lists to isolate the elements corresponding to the left and right subtrees.  The length of the `left_preorder` list is determined by the `root_index_inorder` from the `inorder` list.\n\n4. **Node Creation:** Finally, a `TreeNode` is created with the root value and the recursively constructed left and right subtrees, and it is returned.\n\n5. **Example Usage:** The example shows how to use the `buildTree` function and a helper function `printInorder` to verify the construction.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently constructs the binary tree using recursion and leverages the inherent structure provided by preorder and inorder traversals.  The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, because each node is visited once. The space complexity is also O(N) due to the recursive calls on the call stack.\n",
  "87": "The problem of constructing a binary tree from its inorder and postorder traversals leverages the properties of these traversals.  Postorder traversal follows the pattern `(left subtree)(right subtree)(root)`, while inorder traversal follows `(left subtree)(root)(right subtree)`.

We create a `TreeNode` with this value.\n\n3. **Find Root Index in Inorder:** We find the index of the root in the `inorder` traversal.  This index is crucial because it separates the left and right subtrees in `inorder`.\n\n4. **Divide and Conquer:** We split both `inorder` and `postorder` into left and right subtrees based on the `root_index`.  The length of the left subtree is `root_index`, and the length of the right subtree is the remaining elements. Note that we exclude the root from `right_postorder`.\n\n5. **Recursive Calls:** We recursively call `buildTree` with the left and right subtrees' inorder and postorder traversals to construct the left and right subtrees of the root node.\n\n6. **Return the Root:** Finally, we return the `root` node, which is the root of the entire constructed binary tree.\n\n\nThis algorithm has a time complexity of O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree because each node is visited once. The space complexity is also O(N) due to the recursive call stack.  The space used is proportional to the height of the tree, which can be O(N) in the worst case (a skewed tree).\n",
  "88": "The problem asks for a bottom-up level order traversal, meaning we need to traverse the tree level by level, but output the levels in reverse order (from the deepest level to the root).  We can achieve this using a combination of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and list reversal.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef levelOrderBottom(root):\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs a bottom-up level order traversal of a binary tree.\n\n    Args:\n        root: The root node of the binary tree.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of lists, where each inner list represents a level in the tree,\n        starting from the bottom level.

If so, we return an empty list because there's no tree to traverse.\n   - `result`: An empty list to store the levels of the tree.\n   - `queue`: A `deque` (double-ended queue) is used for efficient FIFO (First-In, First-Out) operations in BFS. We initialize it with the root node.\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**\n   - The `while queue` loop continues as long as there are nodes in the queue.\n   - `level_size`: Stores the number of nodes at the current level. This is crucial for processing each level separately.\n   - `current_level`: An empty list to store the values of nodes at the current level.\n   - The inner `for` loop iterates `level_size` times, processing each node at the current level.\n   - `queue.popleft()`: Removes and returns the first node from the queue (FIFO).\n   - `current_level.append(node.val)`: Adds the node's value to the `current_level` list.\n   - We add the left and right children of the current node to the queue if they exist.\n\n3. **Appending Levels:**\n   - After processing all nodes at a level, `current_level` is appended to the `result` list.\n\n4. **Reversal:**\n   - Finally, `result[::-1]` reverses the `result` list, giving us the bottom-up level order traversal.\n\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the level order traversal and the subsequent reversal to produce the desired output. The use of `deque` ensures optimal performance for queue operations.  The handling of the `None` root case makes the function robust.\n",
  "89": "The problem asks us to transform a sorted array into a balanced binary search tree (BST).  A balanced BST ensures that the height of the tree is minimized, preventing worst-case scenarios (like a skewed tree resembling a linked list) that lead to O(n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef sortedArrayToBST(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts a sorted array to a height-balanced BST.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A sorted list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The root of the constructed BST.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not nums:\n        return None\n\n    mid = len(nums) // 2  # Find the middle element\n\n    root = TreeNode(nums[mid])  # Create the root node\n\n    # Recursively build the left and right subtrees\n    root.left = sortedArrayToBST(nums[:mid])\n    root.right = sortedArrayToBST(nums[mid + 1:])\n\n    return root\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]\nroot = sortedArrayToBST(nums)\n\n# Function to print the inorder traversal (to verify BST property) - optional\ndef inorder_traversal(node):\n    if node:\n        inorder_traversal(node.left)\n        print(node.val, end=\" \")\n        inorder_traversal(node.right)\n\nprint(\"Inorder traversal of the BST:\")\ninorder_traversal(root) # Output should be: -10 -3 0 5 9\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`TreeNode` Class:** This class defines the structure of a node in the binary tree, holding a value (`val`), a left child (`left`), and a right child (`right`).\n\n2. **`sortedArrayToBST(nums)` Function:**\n   - **Base Case:** If the input array `nums` is empty, it returns `None` (an empty tree).\n   - **Finding the Middle:** It finds the middle element of the array using `mid = len(nums) // 2`.  Integer division (`//`) ensures we get an integer index.\n   - **Creating the Root:** A `TreeNode` is created using the middle element as its value. This node becomes the root of the BST.\n   - **Recursive Calls:** The function recursively calls itself twice:\n     - `root.left = sortedArrayToBST(nums[:mid])`:  Builds the left subtree using the portion of the array *before* the middle element.\n     - `root.right = sortedArrayToBST(nums[mid + 1:])`: Builds the right subtree using the portion of the array *after* the middle element.\n   - **Return Value:** The function returns the `root` node of the constructed BST.\n\n3. **Height-Balanced Property:** By repeatedly selecting the middle element as the root, we ensure that the tree is approximately balanced.  The height of the tree will be roughly log\u2082(n), where n is the number of nodes. This guarantees efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.\n\n4. **Inorder Traversal (Optional):** The `inorder_traversal` function is a helper function to verify that the constructed tree is indeed a BST.  An inorder traversal of a BST will always produce a sorted sequence.\n\n\nThis approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, effectively splitting the problem into smaller subproblems until the base case is reached.  The time complexity is O(n) because each element in the array is visited once during the recursive calls. The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case due to the recursive call stack (though it's O(log n) on average for a balanced tree).\n",
  "90": "The problem asks us to transform a sorted singly linked list into a height-balanced Binary Search Tree (BST). A height-balanced BST is a tree where the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.

When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.  This is efficient (O(n) time complexity).\n\n2. **Recursive Construction:**\n   - The middle element of the list becomes the root of the BST.\n   - Recursively call `sortedListToBST` on the left half of the list (from `head` to `slow.next`) to build the left subtree.\n   - Recursively call `sortedListToBST` on the right half of the list (from `slow.next` onwards) to build the right subtree.\n   - This ensures that the BST is built in a balanced manner because we always choose the middle element as the root.\n\n3. **Base Case:** The recursion stops when the list becomes empty (`slow` is `None`), returning `None` to represent an empty subtree.\n\n4. **Inorder Traversal (Verification):** The `inorderTraversal` function is a helper function to print the BST's nodes in ascending order. This is a useful way to verify that the BST has been constructed correctly.  Inorder traversal of a BST always yields a sorted sequence.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.  This is because finding the middle takes O(n) time, and we recursively build the tree, which takes O(log n) levels of recursion.  Each level involves iterating through a portion of the list.\n\n- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) in the best and average case (height-balanced tree),  and O(n) in the worst case (unbalanced tree, although our algorithm aims to prevent this). The space complexity comes from the recursion stack and the tree itself.  The linked list's space is not counted as it's part of the input.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently converts a sorted linked list to a height-balanced BST, leveraging the sorted nature of the input to minimize the height of the resulting tree and thus optimize search time. Remember to define the `ListNode` and `TreeNode` classes before running the code.\n",

It calls the helper function `checkHeight`.\n\n3. **`checkHeight(node)` function:** This is a recursive helper function that performs a post-order traversal.  For each node:\n   - It recursively calculates the height and balance status of the left and right subtrees.\n   - It calculates the height of the current subtree as the maximum of the left and right subtree heights plus 1.\n   - It determines if the current subtree is balanced by checking:\n     - If both subtrees are balanced.\n     - If the absolute difference between the left and right subtree heights is less than or equal to 1.\n   - It returns both the height and the balance status as a tuple.\n\n4. **Post-order Traversal:** The `checkHeight` function implicitly uses a post-order traversal (left, right, root) because it recursively processes the left and right subtrees before calculating the height and balance of the current node. This ensures that the heights of the subtrees are available when checking the balance of the parent node.  This is crucial for efficiency;  calculating height repeatedly for each node would lead to O(N^2) complexity.\n\n5. **Time and Space Complexity:**\n   - **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  Each node is visited only once.\n   - **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (a skewed tree), H can be N, but in a balanced tree, H is log N.\n\n\nThis solution is both correct and efficient, providing a clear and concise way to determine if a binary tree is height-balanced.  The use of a helper function significantly improves readability and avoids unnecessary code duplication.\n",

It's initialized with a tuple containing the `root` node and its depth (1).\n   - **BFS Loop:** The `while` loop continues as long as the queue is not empty.\n   - **Dequeue and Check:** In each iteration, a node and its depth are dequeued.

If they are equal, it means a path with the target sum is found, so it returns `True`.\n   - **Recursive Step:** Otherwise, it recursively explores the left and right subtrees by calling `dfs` on them.  The `if node.left else False` and `if node.right else False` handles cases where a node might only have one child.\n   - It returns `True` if either the left or right subtree returns `True` (meaning a path with the target sum was found in either subtree). Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\n\nThe DFS approach efficiently explores all root-to-leaf paths. The use of recursion makes the code concise and readable.  The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, because each node is visited at most once. The space complexity is O(H) in the worst case, where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack.  In a balanced tree, H is log(N), and in a skewed tree, H can be N.\n",

If they match, a *copy* of the `path` list is appended to the `result` list (creating a copy is crucial to prevent modifications from affecting other paths).\n   - **Recursive Calls:** It recursively calls `dfs` for the left and right children of the current node.\n   - **Backtracking:** After processing a node's subtrees, it removes the node's value from the `path` using `path.pop()`. This is essential for exploring other paths correctly.  This \"backtracking\" step ensures that when we return from a recursive call, the `path` is restored to its state before entering that call.\n\n4. **Initial Call to dfs:** The `pathSum` function starts the DFS by calling `dfs` with the root node, an initial `current_sum` of 0, and an empty `path` list.\n\n5. **Return Value:** The function returns the `result` list containing all the paths that sum up to `targetSum`.\n\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nroot = TreeNode(5)\nroot.left = TreeNode(4)\nroot.right = TreeNode(8)\nroot.left.left = TreeNode(11)\nroot.left.left.left = TreeNode(7)\nroot.left.left.right = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right.left = TreeNode(13)\nroot.right.right = TreeNode(4)\nroot.right.right.right = TreeNode(1)\n\ntargetSum = 22\npaths = pathSum(root, targetSum)\nprint(paths)  # Output: [[5, 4, 11, 2], [5, 8, 4, 5]] (order may vary)\n\n```\n\nThis example demonstrates how the code finds all paths with the specified sum.  Remember that the order of paths in the output list might vary slightly depending on the order of DFS exploration (left subtree before right subtree).  The important part is that all valid paths are included in the result.\n",

It handles the base case of an empty tree and calls the recursive helper function.\n\n3. **`flatten_helper(node)` Function:** This recursive function does the core work:\n   - **Base Case:** If the node is a leaf node (no left or right children), it's already flattened, so it returns the node itself.\n   - **Recursive Calls:** It recursively flattens the left and right subtrees.\n   - **Connecting Subtrees:** The crucial part is connecting the flattened left subtree to the right of the current node and then setting the current node's left child to `None`.  This restructures the tree.\n   - **Return Value:** The function returns the tail of the flattened subtree (the rightmost node of the flattened subtree). This is important for linking subtrees correctly.\n\n4. **Example Usage:**  The code creates a sample binary tree and then calls `flatten()` to flatten it. The final `while` loop iterates through the flattened linked list, printing the values to verify the result.\n\n\nThis solution uses a recursive approach which is efficient and clearly demonstrates the logic of connecting the subtrees in-place. The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to the recursion stack), and the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as each node is visited exactly once.\n",
  "96": "The problem requires modifying a perfect binary tree's structure.  Each node needs an extra pointer, `next`, to point to the node immediately to its right on the same level.  We can't use recursion efficiently because we need to traverse level by level.  The optimal solution involves iterative level-order traversal using a queue.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: 'Node' = None, right: 'Node' = None, next: 'Node' = None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n        self.next = next\n\ndef connect(root: 'Node') -> 'Node':\n    \"\"\"\n    Populates the next pointers of a perfect binary tree.\n\n    Args:\n        root: The root node of the perfect binary tree.\n\n    Returns:\n        The root node with populated next pointers.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not root:\n        return root\n\n    queue = deque([root])  # Use a deque for efficient queue operations\n\n    while queue:\n        level_size = len(queue)  # Number of nodes at the current level\n\n        for i in range(level_size):\n            node = queue.popleft()\n\n            # Connect to the next node on the same level\n            if i < level_size - 1:\n                node.next = queue[0]  # queue[0] is the next node\n\n            # Add children to the queue for the next level\n            if node.left:\n                queue.append(node.left)\n            if node.right:\n                queue.append(node.right)\n\n    return root\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Node Class:**  We define a `Node` class to represent the nodes in the binary tree, including the `next` pointer.\n\n2. **`connect(root)` Function:** This function takes the root node as input and performs the level-order traversal.\n\n3. **Queue Initialization:** A `deque` (double-ended queue) is used for efficient adding and removing elements from both ends, making it ideal for level-order traversal.  The root node is initially added to the queue.\n\n4. **Level-Order Traversal:** The `while queue` loop iterates through each level of the tree.  `level_size` stores the number of nodes at the current level.\n\n5. **Connecting Next Pointers:** Inside the inner `for` loop, we process each node at the current level.  `node.next` is set to the next node in the queue (`queue[0]`) if it's not the last node on the level.\n\n6. **Adding Children:**  The `if` conditions add the left and right children of the current node to the queue for processing in the next iteration. This ensures that the next level is processed correctly.\n\n7. **Return Value:** The function returns the modified `root` node with all `next` pointers correctly populated.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nroot = Node(1)\nroot.left = Node(2)\nroot.right = Node(3)\nroot.left.left = Node(4)\nroot.left.right = Node(5)\nroot.right.left = Node(6)\nroot.right.right = Node(7)\n\nconnect(root)\n\n# Verify the connections (optional)\nprint(root.left.next.val)  # Output: 3\nprint(root.right.next)  # Output: None\nprint(root.left.left.next.val) # Output: 5\n```\n\nThis code efficiently solves the problem using level-order traversal with a queue, avoiding the complexities and potential inefficiencies of recursive approaches for this specific problem.  The use of `deque` ensures optimal performance for queue operations.\n",
  "97": "The problem asks us to connect nodes at the same level in a binary tree using a `next` pointer.  We can't use extra space proportional to the tree's size.  This means we can't use a queue or recursion that keeps track of all nodes at a level.  Instead, we'll use a level-order traversal using only a single `dummy` node to track the start of each level.\n\nHere's the Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: 'Node' = None, right: 'Node' = None, next: 'Node' = None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n        self.next = next\n\ndef connect(root: 'Node') -> 'Node':\n    \"\"\"\n    Connects the nodes at each level of a binary tree using the 'next' pointer.\n\n    Args:\n        root: The root node of the binary tree.\n\n    Returns:\n        The root node of the modified binary tree.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not root:\n        return root\n\n    # Dummy node to simplify traversal\n    dummy = Node()  \n    current = dummy\n\n    while root:  # Iterate level by level\n        if root.left:\n            current.next = root.left\n            current = current.next\n        if root.right:\n            current.next = root.right\n            current = current.next\n\n        root = root.next # Move to the next node at the current level\n\n        #If we reach the end of the level, reset 'current' and 'root'\n        if root is None:\n            current = dummy  # Reset for the next level\n            root = dummy.next # Move root to the start of the next level\n            dummy.next = None # Reset the dummy node\n\n\n    return root\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **`Node` Class:** This class defines the structure of a node in the binary tree, including `val`, `left`, `right`, and `next` pointers.\n\n2. **`connect(root)` Function:** This function performs the level-order traversal to connect the nodes.\n\n3. **Dummy Node:** The `dummy` node is a crucial element for this constant space solution. It acts as a pointer to the beginning of each level.  This avoids needing to track the head of each level explicitly.\n\n4. **Level-Order Traversal:** The `while root` loop iterates through levels.  Inside the loop:\n\n   - It checks if the `root` node (which initially points to the start of the current level) has left and right children.\n   - If a child exists, its `next` pointer is linked to the `current` node (which is initially the dummy node, effectively acting as our tail). Then the `current` node is moved forward.\n   - `root = root.next` moves us to the next node in the current level.\n\n5. **Level Transition:**  When `root` becomes `None` (meaning we've reached the end of the current level), the following happens:\n    - `current = dummy` resets `current` to the dummy node to prepare for the next level.\n    - `root = dummy.next` sets `root` to the first node of the next level (previously linked by the `current` pointer).\n    - `dummy.next = None`  clears the dummy node's `next` pointer for the next iteration.\n\n\nThis approach cleverly uses the `next` pointers to maintain the order and iterate through each level without using extra space beyond the `dummy` node and a few pointers. The algorithm is efficient with a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, as it visits each node once.  The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space.\n\n\nThis solution is more concise and easier to understand than solutions that rely on explicit queues or recursive calls that maintain level information.  The use of the dummy node is a key technique to achieve constant space complexity in this problem.\n",

It initializes `total_sum` to 0.  The core logic resides within the nested `dfs` function.\n\n3. **dfs Function:** This is a recursive helper function that performs the Depth-First Search.\n\n   - `nonlocal total_sum`: This keyword is crucial because it allows the inner `dfs` function to modify the `total_sum` variable defined in the outer `sumNumbers` function.  Without `nonlocal`, a new local variable `total_sum` would be created within `dfs`, and changes wouldn't affect the overall sum.\n\n   - `current_number = current_number * 10 + node.val`: This line constructs the root-to-leaf number as we traverse down the tree.  Each time we visit a node, we append its value to the `current_number` by multiplying the existing number by 10 (shifting digits to the left) and adding the node's value.\n\n   - **Leaf Node Check:** `if node.left is None and node.right is None:`  This condition checks if the current node is a leaf node (no children). If it is, the `current_number` is added to `total_sum`.\n\n   - **Recursive Calls:** `dfs(node.left, current_number)` and `dfs(node.right, current_number)` recursively call `dfs` on the left and right subtrees, respectively, passing the updated `current_number`.\n\n4. **Return Value:** The `sumNumbers` function returns the final `total_sum` after the DFS traversal is complete.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nroot = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2), TreeNode(3))\nresult = sumNumbers(root)\nprint(f\"Sum of root-to-leaf numbers: {result}\")  # Output: 25 (12 + 13)\n\n\nroot = TreeNode(4, TreeNode(9, TreeNode(5), TreeNode(1)), TreeNode(0))\nresult = sumNumbers(root)\nprint(f\"Sum of root-to-leaf numbers: {result}\")  # Output: 1026 (495 + 491 + 40)\n```\n\nThis comprehensive explanation and code provide a clear understanding of how to solve the \"Sum Root to Leaf Numbers\" problem efficiently using Depth-First Search in Python.

If `num - 1` is in the set, it means `num` is part of a sequence already being considered from a smaller number.\n\n3. **Extend the Streak:** If a starting number is found, a `while` loop extends the streak as long as consecutive numbers (`current_num + 1`) are present in the `num_set`.\n\n4. **Update Longest Streak:**  After each sequence is processed, `longest_streak` is updated to track the maximum length found so far.\n\n5. **Return the Result:** Finally, the function returns `longest_streak`, representing the length of the longest consecutive sequence in the input array.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n) because each number is visited at most twice (once in the outer loop and once in the inner loop if it is part of a sequence). Set lookups (`in num_set`) are O(1) on average.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case because the `num_set` can store all the unique numbers from the input array.\n\n\nThis optimized approach ensures that the solution meets the requirement of O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for large input arrays.\n",
  "100": "The Word Ladder problem can be efficiently solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

In the worst case, we might explore all possible word variations.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(M * N) in the worst case, due to the `visited` set and the `queue`.  The queue's size can grow to be proportional to the number of words in the graph explored.\n\n\nThis solution is optimized for clarity and readability.  Further optimizations are possible (e.g., using a Trie for faster neighbor generation), but they add complexity without significantly altering the core algorithm.\n",
  "101": "The \"Longest Palindromic Substring\" problem aims to find the longest sequence of characters within a given string that reads the same forwards and backward.  There are several ways to solve this, but we'll explore a dynamic programming approach and a more efficient expand-around-center approach.\n\n**Method 1: Dynamic Programming**\n\nThis method uses a table to store whether substrings are palindromes.\n\n```python\ndef longestPalindrome_dp(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest palindromic substring using dynamic programming.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        The longest palindromic substring.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(s)\n    if n < 2:  # Base cases: empty or single-character string\n        return s\n\n    # Create a table to store whether substrings are palindromes\n    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]\n\n    # All single characters are palindromes\n    for i in range(n):\n        dp[i][i] = True\n\n    # Initialize variables to track the longest palindrome\n    start = 0\n    max_len = 1\n\n    # Check for palindromes of length 2\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if s[i] == s[i + 1]:\n            dp[i][i + 1] = True\n            start = i\n            max_len = 2\n\n    # Check for palindromes of length 3 or greater\n    for k in range(3, n + 1):  # k represents the length of the substring\n        for i in range(n - k + 1):\n            j = i + k - 1\n            if s[i] == s[j] and dp[i + 1][j - 1]:  # Check outer characters and inner substring\n                dp[i][j] = True\n                if k > max_len:\n                    start = i\n                    max_len = k\n\n    return s[start:start + max_len]\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Base Cases:**  Strings of length 0 or 1 are palindromes.\n2. **Initialization:** The `dp` table is initialized. `dp[i][j]` is True if the substring from index `i` to `j` (inclusive) is a palindrome.  We initially set all single characters to be palindromes.\n3. **Length 2 Palindromes:** We iterate to check all substrings of length 2.\n4. **Length 3 and Greater:** We iterate through possible substring lengths (`k`) and starting indices (`i`).  If the outer characters (`s[i]` and `s[j]`) are equal and the inner substring (`s[i+1:j-1]`) is a palindrome (checked using `dp[i+1][j-1]`), then the entire substring is a palindrome.\n5. **Tracking the Longest Palindrome:** We keep track of the `start` index and `max_len` to identify the longest palindrome found.\n\n\n**Method 2: Expand Around Center**\n\nThis method is more efficient. It iterates through each character (and between characters) as a potential center of a palindrome and expands outwards.\n\n```python\ndef longestPalindrome_expand(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest palindromic substring by expanding around the center.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        The longest palindromic substring.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(s)\n    if n < 2:\n        return s\n\n    start = 0\n    max_len = 1\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Odd length palindromes\n        l, r = i, i\n        while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:\n            if r - l + 1 > max_len:\n                start = l\n                max_len = r - l + 1\n            l -= 1\n            r += 1\n\n        # Even length palindromes\n        l, r = i, i + 1\n        while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:\n            if r - l + 1 > max_len:\n                start = l\n                max_len = r - l + 1\n            l -= 1\n            r += 1\n\n    return s[start:start + max_len]\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Iteration:** The code iterates through each character as a potential center of a palindrome.\n2. **Odd Length Palindromes:** It expands outwards from a single character center.\n3. **Even Length Palindromes:** It expands outwards from a center between two characters.\n4. **Tracking the Longest Palindrome:** Similar to the dynamic programming approach, it tracks the `start` index and `max_len`.\n\n\n**Comparison:**\n\nThe expand-around-center approach is generally preferred because it has a time complexity of O(n^2), which is the same as dynamic programming, but it uses less space (O(1) vs O(n^2) for the DP table).  Therefore, the `longestPalindrome_expand` function is more efficient in terms of space complexity.\n\n\nBoth functions achieve the same result.  Choose the one that best suits your understanding and space constraints.  For most cases, `longestPalindrome_expand` is recommended.\n",
  "102": "The Longest Common Prefix problem can be solved in several ways. Here's a Python solution with a detailed explanation, focusing on an efficient approach using character-by-character comparison:\n\n```python\ndef longest_common_prefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs: A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        The longest common prefix string, or \"\" if there is no common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not strs:  # Handle empty input list\n        return \"\"\n\n    prefix = strs[0]  # Initialize prefix with the first string\n\n    for string in strs[1:]:  # Iterate through the remaining strings\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(prefix) and i < len(string) and prefix[i] == string[i]:\n            i += 1  # Increment i as long as characters match\n        prefix = prefix[:i]  # Update prefix to the common part\n\n        if not prefix:  # If prefix becomes empty, no common prefix exists\n            return \"\"\n\n    return prefix\n\n# Example usage:\nstrings1 = [\"flower\",\"flow\",\"flight\"]\nprint(f\"Longest common prefix of {strings1}: {longest_common_prefix(strings1)}\")  # Output: fl\n\nstrings2 = [\"dog\",\"racecar\",\"car\"]\nprint(f\"Longest common prefix of {strings2}: {longest_common_prefix(strings2)}\")  # Output: \"\"\n\nstrings3 = [\"apple\", \"app\", \"appetizer\"]\nprint(f\"Longest common prefix of {strings3}: {longest_common_prefix(strings3)}\") # Output: ap\n\nstrings4 = []\nprint(f\"Longest common prefix of {strings4}: {longest_common_prefix(strings4)}\") # Output: \"\"\n\nstrings5 = [\"interspecies\", \"interstellar\", \"interstate\"]\nprint(f\"Longest common prefix of {strings5}: {longest_common_prefix(strings5)}\") # Output: inter\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handle Empty Input:** The function first checks if the input list `strs` is empty. If it is, an empty string \"\" is returned immediately because there's no common prefix among no strings.\n\n2. **Initialize Prefix:** The prefix is initialized with the first string in the list (`strs[0]`).  This is our starting point for comparison.\n\n3. **Iterate and Compare:** The code iterates through the remaining strings in the list (`strs[1:]`). For each string:\n   - A `while` loop compares characters at the same index (`i`) in the current `prefix` and the current `string`.\n   - The loop continues as long as:\n     - `i` is within the bounds of both `prefix` and `string`.\n     - The characters at index `i` are equal.\n   - `i` is incremented with each matching character.\n\n4. **Update Prefix:** After the inner `while` loop, `prefix` is updated to include only the characters up to index `i`. This effectively truncates the `prefix` to the common part found so far.\n\n5. **Empty Prefix Check:** If, at any point, the `prefix` becomes an empty string (meaning no common characters were found between the current `prefix` and a string), the function immediately returns an empty string, indicating no common prefix exists.\n\n6. **Return Prefix:** After iterating through all strings, the final value of `prefix` represents the longest common prefix, which is returned.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it avoids unnecessary comparisons. It stops comparing characters as soon as a mismatch is found, and it updates the prefix dynamically.  The time complexity is O(S), where S is the sum of the lengths of all strings in the input list (in the worst case, we might iterate through all characters of all strings).  The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.\n",

This handles cases where the string might start with spaces.\n\n2. **Sign Handling:** The code checks if the first non-whitespace character is '-' or '+'.  If it's '-', the `sign` variable is set to -1; otherwise, it remains 1 (positive). The sign character is then removed from the string `s`.\n\n3. **Digit Conversion:** The code iterates through the remaining string.  Inside the loop:\n   - `if not char.isdigit(): break` stops the loop as soon as a non-digit character is encountered. This is crucial because we only want to process the digits.\n   - `result = result * 10 + int(char)`  This line is the core of the integer conversion.  It performs the following steps for each digit:\n     - Multiplies the current `result` by 10 (shifting the existing digits to the left).\n     - Adds the integer value of the current digit (`int(char)`).\n\n4. **Sign Application:** After the loop finishes, the `result` is multiplied by `sign`. This applies the correct sign (positive or negative).\n\n5. **Range Clamping:** The code then checks if the `result` falls outside the 32-bit signed integer range (`INT_MIN` to `INT_MAX`). If it does, the result is clamped to the nearest boundary value.\n\n6. **Return Value:** Finally, the function returns the clamped `result`.\n\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nprint(myAtoi(\"42\"))      # Output: 42\nprint(myAtoi(\"   -42\"))   # Output: -42\nprint(myAtoi(\"4193 with words\"))  # Output: 4193\nprint(myAtoi(\"words and 987\"))  # Output: 0\nprint(myAtoi(\"-91283472332\")) # Output: -2147483648 (clamped to INT_MIN)\nprint(myAtoi(\"9223372036854775808\")) # Output: 2147483647 (clamped to INT_MAX)\n\n```\n\nThis improved solution efficiently handles various edge cases and clearly demonstrates the logic behind the string-to-integer conversion process.

The loop that initializes `dp[0][j]` handles cases where the pattern starts with `*`.  For example, \"a*\" matches \"\", so `dp[0][2]` should be True.\n\n* **Iteration:** The nested loops iterate through all possible prefixes of `s` and `p`.\n\n* **Matching:**\n    * If `p[j-1]` is a literal character or '.' and it matches `s[i-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.  We've matched the current characters, so the result depends on whether the preceding substrings matched.\n    * If `p[j-1]` is '*', it's more complex:\n        * `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]` handles the case where we match zero occurrences of the preceding element.\n        * `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] or dp[i-1][j]` handles the case where we match one or more occurrences.  This is only considered if the preceding element ( `p[j-2]` ) matches `s[i-1]`.\n\n\nThis dynamic programming solution avoids redundant calculations and provides an efficient way to solve the regular expression matching problem.  Its time complexity is O(mn), where m and n are the lengths of the string and pattern respectively, and space complexity is also O(mn) due to the DP table.\n",

The area is limited by the shorter line.\n   - `max_area_so_far`: Updates the maximum area if `current_area` is greater.\n\n3. **Pointer Movement:**\n   - The crucial part is moving the pointers.  We move the pointer pointing to the shorter line.  Why?  Because moving the taller line will never increase the area.  The area is constrained by the shorter line's height, and moving the taller line only decreases the width. Moving the shorter line *might* find a taller line that increases the area.\n\n4. **Return Value:**\n   - After the loop completes, `max_area_so_far` contains the maximum area found.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(n) because the pointers traverse the array once.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space.\n\n\nThis two-pointer approach significantly improves the efficiency compared to the brute-force method, making it a suitable solution for larger input arrays.\n",

Returns an empty string if input is invalid.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not 1 <= num <= 3999:\n        return \"\"  # Handle invalid input\n\n    roman_map = { 1: 'I', 4: 'IV', 5: 'V', 9: 'IX', 10: 'X', 40: 'XL', 50: 'L', 90: 'XC',\n                  100: 'C', 400: 'CD', 500: 'D', 900: 'CM', 1000: 'M'}\n\n    integers = list(roman_map)\n    symbols = list(roman_map.values())\n\n    i = 12\n    result = \"\"\n\n    while num != 0:\n        if integers[i] <= num:\n            result += symbols[i]\n            num -= integers[i]\n        else:\n            i -= 1\n\n    return result\n\n# Example Usage\nprint(int_to_roman(3))  # Output: III\nprint(int_to_roman(4))  # Output: IV\nprint(int_to_roman(9))  # Output: IX\nprint(int_to_roman(58)) # Output: LVIII\nprint(int_to_roman(1994)) # Output: MCMXCIV\nprint(int_to_roman(0)) # Output: (empty string)\nprint(int_to_roman(4000)) # Output: (empty string)\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Input Validation:** The function first checks if the input `num` is within the valid range (1 to 3999).  Roman numerals traditionally don't represent numbers outside this range.  If the input is invalid, an empty string is returned.\n\n2. **Roman Numeral Mapping:** A dictionary `roman_map` stores the mapping between integer values and their Roman numeral representations.  This includes both additive (e.g., 1: 'I', 5: 'V') and subtractive (e.g., 4: 'IV', 9: 'IX') combinations for efficiency.  The order of entries in this dictionary is crucial for the algorithm's correctness.\n\n3. **Iteration and Subtraction:** The code iterates through the `integers` list (keys of `roman_map`) in descending order.  For each integer, it checks if it's less than or equal to the remaining `num`.  If it is, the corresponding Roman numeral symbol is appended to the `result`, and the integer is subtracted from `num`. This process continues until `num` becomes 0.\n\n4. **Return Value:** Finally, the function returns the `result` string, which contains the constructed Roman numeral.\n\nThis approach is efficient because it directly handles the subtractive combinations, avoiding unnecessary iterations or complex conditional logic. The descending order of iteration ensures that larger denominations are processed first, leading to a correct and concise Roman numeral representation. The use of a dictionary provides a clear and easily maintainable mapping between integers and symbols.\n",

This makes the code more readable and efficient than using multiple `if-elif-else` statements.\n\n2. **Iteration from Right to Left:** The code iterates through the Roman numeral string from right to left. This is crucial for handling subtractive cases correctly.  Reading right-to-left allows us to easily compare the current numeral's value to the previously processed one.\n\n3. **Subtractive Cases:** The core logic lies in the `if curr_value < prev_value:` condition. If the current value is less than the previous value (e.g., 'I' before 'V'), it means we have a subtractive case (IV = 4, not 6).  In this case, we subtract the current value from the result. Otherwise, we add the current value.\n\n4. **`prev_value` Variable:** The `prev_value` variable stores the value of the previously processed Roman numeral character. This allows for easy comparison to determine if a subtractive case exists.\n\n5. **Error Handling:** The code includes a basic check to see if the input character is a valid Roman numeral. If not, it returns -1, indicating an invalid input.\n\n6. **Efficiency:** The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the Roman numeral string, because it iterates through the string once.  The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a fixed-size dictionary and a few integer variables, regardless of the input size.\n\n\nThis solution provides a clear, efficient, and robust way to convert Roman numerals to integers in Python, handling both standard additive and subtractive cases, and providing basic input validation.\n",
  "108": "The Longest Common Prefix problem can be solved efficiently using several approaches. Here's a Python solution using a character-by-character comparison, along with a detailed explanation and an alternative approach:\n\n**Method 1: Character-by-Character Comparison**\n\nThis approach iterates through the strings character by character, comparing the characters at the same index in all strings.  It stops when a mismatch is found or the end of one of the strings is reached.\n\n```python\ndef longestCommonPrefix(strs):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.\n\n    Args:\n        strs: A list of strings.\n\n    Returns:\n        The longest common prefix string, or \"\" if there is no common prefix.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not strs:  # Handle empty input list\n        return \"\"\n\n    prefix = \"\"\n    shortest_str = min(strs, key=len)  # Find the shortest string for efficiency\n\n    for i in range(len(shortest_str)):\n        char = shortest_str[i]\n        is_common = all(s[i] == char for s in strs) # Check if char is common to all strings\n\n        if is_common:\n            prefix += char\n        else:\n            break  # Exit loop if mismatch found\n\n    return prefix\n\n#Example Usage\nstrs1 = [\"flower\",\"flow\",\"flight\"]\nprint(f\"Longest common prefix of {strs1}: {longestCommonPrefix(strs1)}\") # Output: fl\n\nstrs2 = [\"dog\",\"racecar\",\"car\"]\nprint(f\"Longest common prefix of {strs2}: {longestCommonPrefix(strs2)}\") # Output: \"\"\n\nstrs3 = [\"apple\", \"app\", \"appetizer\"]\nprint(f\"Longest common prefix of {strs3}: {longestCommonPrefix(strs3)}\") # Output: ap\n\nstrs4 = []\nprint(f\"Longest common prefix of {strs4}: {longestCommonPrefix(strs4)}\") # Output: \"\"\n\nstrs5 = [\"interspecies\", \"interstellar\", \"interstate\"]\nprint(f\"Longest common prefix of {strs5}: {longestCommonPrefix(strs5)}\") #Output: inter\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handle Empty Input:** The function first checks if the input list `strs` is empty. If it is, an empty string is returned.\n\n2. **Find Shortest String:** It finds the shortest string in the list using `min(strs, key=len)`. This is an optimization because the longest common prefix cannot be longer than the shortest string.\n\n3. **Character-by-Character Comparison:** The code iterates through the characters of the shortest string.  For each character, it uses `all(s[i] == char for s in strs)` to check if that character is present at the same index in all other strings.  The `all()` function efficiently short-circuits \u2013 if it finds a single `False`, it immediately returns `False` without checking the rest.\n\n4. **Building the Prefix:** If the character is common to all strings, it's appended to the `prefix`.  If a mismatch is found, the loop breaks, and the current `prefix` is returned.\n\n\n**Method 2: Using `os.path.commonprefix` (Alternative)**\n\nPython's `os` module provides a function `os.path.commonprefix` that directly calculates the longest common prefix of a list of strings.  This is a concise alternative, though it might be slightly less efficient for very large lists than the character-by-character approach because it internally performs a similar comparison.\n\n\n```python\nimport os\n\ndef longestCommonPrefix_os(strs):\n    return os.path.commonprefix(strs)\n\n# Example usage (same output as Method 1)\nprint(longestCommonPrefix_os(strs1)) # Output: fl\nprint(longestCommonPrefix_os(strs2)) # Output: \"\"\nprint(longestCommonPrefix_os(strs3)) # Output: ap\nprint(longestCommonPrefix_os(strs4)) # Output: \"\"\nprint(longestCommonPrefix_os(strs5)) # Output: inter\n```\n\nBoth methods achieve the same result.  The character-by-character approach is generally preferred for its better efficiency, especially when dealing with a large number of long strings, while `os.path.commonprefix` offers a more compact solution.  Choose the method that best suits your needs and coding style.\n",
  "109": "The 3Sum problem requires finding all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero.  A brute-force approach (three nested loops) is inefficient (O(n\u00b3)).

The `if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]: continue` line skips duplicate numbers for the first element of the triplet, ensuring unique triplets in the final result.\n\n3. **Two-pointer technique:** For each `nums[i]`, `left` and `right` pointers are initialized to point to the next element and the last element respectively.\n\n4. **Sum and comparison:** The `current_sum` is calculated. If it's 0, a triplet is found and added to the `result` list. If `current_sum` is less than 0, `left` is incremented (to increase the sum); if it's greater than 0, `right` is decremented (to decrease the sum).\n\n5. **Skipping duplicates:** The `while` loops inside the `if current_sum == 0:` block handle duplicate numbers for the second and third elements of the triplet, ensuring that only unique triplets are added to the `result`.\n\n6. **Return the result:** Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing all the unique triplets that sum to zero.\n\n\nThis approach provides a significant performance improvement over the brute-force method, making it suitable for larger input arrays.  The time complexity is O(n\u00b2), dominated by the nested loops (outer loop iterating through n elements and inner loop (two pointers) iterating through at most n elements), and the space complexity is O(1) (excluding the space used for the output list), as we're only using a few extra variables.\n",

This is essential for the efficient two-pointer approach.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The outer loop iterates from `i = 0` to `n - 3` (because we need at least three elements).\n\n3. **Two-Pointer Approach:** For each `nums[i]`, we use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to explore the remaining elements. `left` starts at `i + 1` and `right` starts at `n - 1`.\n\n4. **Sum Calculation and Comparison:**  `current_sum` is calculated. We then compare `abs(current_sum - target)` with `abs(closest_sum - target)` to track the sum closest to the target seen so far.\n\n5. **Pointer Adjustment:**\n   - If `current_sum < target`, we increment `left` to increase the sum.\n   - If `current_sum > target`, we decrement `right` to decrease the sum.\n   - If `current_sum == target`, we've found an exact match, so we return the target immediately.\n\n6. **Return Value:** After iterating through all possible triplets, the function returns `closest_sum`, which holds the sum closest to the target.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n\u00b2) due to the nested loops (the outer loop iterates n times, and the inner `while` loop iterates at most n times).  The space complexity is O(1) (excluding the space used by the sorted array, which is in-place sorting, so it's considered O(log n) in some analyses, but effectively O(1) for practical purposes).\n",

This allows us to efficiently handle duplicates and use the two-pointer technique.\n\n2. **Outer Loops:** The outer two loops iterate through possible values for `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.  The `continue` statements efficiently skip duplicate values to prevent redundant quadruplets in the result.\n\n3. **Two-Pointer Technique:**  The `left` and `right` pointers maintain a window within the sorted array.  They are adjusted based on whether the `current_sum` is less than, equal to, or greater than the `target`.\n\n4. **Duplicate Handling:**  The `while` loops inside the `if current_sum == target` block are crucial. They skip over consecutive duplicate values for `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` to ensure that only unique quadruplets are added to the `result`.\n\n5. **Return Value:** The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list represents a unique quadruplet that sums to the `target`.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^3) because of the three nested loops. The space complexity is O(1) excluding the space used for the result, which depends on the number of quadruplets found.  The sorting step takes O(n log n) time, but this is dominated by the cubic complexity of the nested loops.\n",
  "112": "The problem requires removing the nth node from the *end* of a linked list.  A naive approach would be to first traverse the list to find its length, then traverse again to find the (length - n)th node.  However, this is inefficient (O(2n) time complexity).  A more efficient solution uses two pointers with a constant distance between them.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef removeNthFromEnd(head, n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes the nth node from the end of a linked list.\n\n    Args:\n        head: The head of the linked list.\n        n: The position of the node to remove from the end (1-indexed).\n\n    Returns:\n        The head of the modified linked list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Handle edge cases: empty list or n larger than list length\n    if not head or n <= 0:\n        return head\n\n    # Use two pointers, 'fast' and 'slow', with an initial distance of n\n    dummy = ListNode(0, head) # Add a dummy node to simplify handling head removal\n    slow = dummy\n    fast = head\n    for _ in range(n):\n        fast = fast.next\n        if not fast:  # Handle case where n is larger than list length\n            return head\n\n\n    # Move both pointers until 'fast' reaches the end\n    while fast.next:\n        slow = slow.next\n        fast = fast.next\n\n    # Remove the nth node from the end by skipping over it\n    slow.next = slow.next.next\n\n    return dummy.next #Return the head (after dummy node)\n\n\n# Example usage:\nhead = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))))\nn = 2\nnew_head = removeNthFromEnd(head, n)\n\n#Print the modified list\nwhile new_head:\n    print(new_head.val, end=\" \")\n    new_head = new_head.next\n# Output: 1 2 3 5\n\nhead = ListNode(1)\nn = 1\nnew_head = removeNthFromEnd(head,n)\n#Print the modified list\nwhile new_head:\n    print(new_head.val, end=\" \")\n    new_head = new_head.next\n#Output: (empty)\n\nhead = ListNode(1, ListNode(2))\nn = 1\nnew_head = removeNthFromEnd(head,n)\n#Print the modified list\nwhile new_head:\n    print(new_head.val, end=\" \")\n    new_head = new_head.next\n#Output: 1\n\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Edge Case Handling:** The code first checks for edge cases: an empty list or `n` being greater than the list's length.  In these situations, the original head is returned.\n\n2. **Dummy Node:** A dummy node is prepended to the list. This simplifies the logic for removing the head node (if `n` is the length of the list).\n\n3. **Two Pointers:** Two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, are initialized.  `fast` is initially `n` nodes ahead of `slow`.\n\n4. **Iteration:** The `while fast.next` loop moves both pointers simultaneously. When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` points to the node *before* the node to be removed.\n\n5. **Node Removal:** The node is removed by updating `slow.next` to skip over the node to be removed.\n\n6. **Return Value:** The function returns `dummy.next`, which is the head of the modified linked list (after removing the dummy node).\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) (one pass through the list) and a space complexity of O(1) (constant extra space).  It's significantly more efficient than the naive approach. Remember that `n` is 1-indexed in the problem description, meaning the last node is n=1, second to last is n=2 and so on.  The code handles this correctly.\n",
  "113": "The solution uses a stack data structure to efficiently track open brackets.  Here's the Python code and a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef isValid(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if a string containing parentheses is valid.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The input string containing parentheses.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the string is valid, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    stack = []  # Initialize an empty stack\n    mapping = {\")\": \"(\", \"}\": \"{\", \"]\": \"[\"}  # Mapping of closing to opening brackets\n\n    for char in s:\n        if char in mapping:  # If it's a closing bracket\n            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#' # Pop the top element. If stack is empty, '#' is used as a placeholder.\n            if mapping[char] != top_element:  # Check if it matches the corresponding opening bracket\n                return False  # Mismatch, invalid string\n        else:  # If it's an opening bracket\n            stack.append(char)  # Push onto the stack\n\n    return not stack  # If the stack is empty at the end, all brackets were closed correctly\n\n# Example Usage\nprint(isValid(\"()\"))  # True\nprint(isValid(\"()[]{}\"))  # True\nprint(isValid(\"(]\"))  # False\nprint(isValid(\"([)]\"))  # False\nprint(isValid(\"{[]}\"))  # True\nprint(isValid(\"(\")) # False - Unclosed parenthesis\n\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `stack = []`: An empty list is used as a stack.  Stacks follow the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.\n   - `mapping = {\")\": \"(\", \"}\": \"{\", \"]\": \"[\"}`: A dictionary maps each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket. This makes it easy to check for matches.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - `for char in s:`: The code iterates through each character in the input string `s`.\n\n3. **Closing Bracket Handling:**\n   - `if char in mapping:`: If the character is a closing bracket (present as a key in the `mapping` dictionary).\n   - `top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'`:  It attempts to pop the top element from the stack.  The `if stack else '#'` part handles the case where the stack is empty (meaning there's no corresponding opening bracket).  We use '#' as a placeholder to avoid an error.\n   - `if mapping[char] != top_element:`: It checks if the popped element (the last opened bracket) matches the expected opening bracket for the current closing bracket.  If they don't match, it means the parentheses are mismatched, and the function returns `False`.\n\n4. **Opening Bracket Handling:**\n   - `else:`: If the character is an opening bracket (not in the `mapping` dictionary).\n   - `stack.append(char)`: The opening bracket is pushed onto the stack.\n\n5. **Final Check:**\n   - `return not stack`: After iterating through the entire string, if the stack is empty (`not stack` evaluates to `True`), it means all opening brackets have been correctly closed.  If the stack is not empty, there are unclosed opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.\n\n**How the Stack Works:**\n\nThe stack keeps track of opened brackets.  When a closing bracket is encountered, the top of the stack (the most recently opened bracket) is checked for a match.  This ensures that brackets are closed in the correct order.  If a closing bracket is encountered without a matching opening bracket on the stack, or if the brackets don't match, the string is invalid.  If all brackets are correctly matched and the stack is empty at the end, the string is valid.\n",
  "114": "The problem of merging two sorted linked lists involves iteratively comparing the heads of the two lists and adding the smaller node to a new merged list. This process continues until one of the input lists is empty, at which point the remaining nodes from the other list are appended to the merged list.\n\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef mergeTwoLists(list1, list2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Merges two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.\n\n    Args:\n        list1: The head of the first sorted linked list.\n        list2: The head of the second sorted linked list.\n\n    Returns:\n        The head of the merged sorted linked list.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Create a dummy node to simplify the logic.

This simplifies the logic of adding the first node to the merged list, avoiding special handling of the head.\n   - **`tail` Pointer:** The `tail` pointer always points to the last node of the merged list, allowing efficient appending.\n   - **`while` Loop:** The loop iterates as long as both `list1` and `list2` are not empty.  Inside the loop:\n     - It compares the values of the head nodes of `list1` and `list2`.\n     - The node with the smaller value is appended to the merged list via `tail.next`.\n     - The head of the list that contributed the node is moved to its next node.\n     - `tail` is moved to the newly added node.\n   - **Appending Remaining Nodes:** After the loop, one of `list1` or `list2` might still have remaining nodes. The line `tail.next = list1 or list2` elegantly handles this case.  If `list1` is empty, it defaults to `list2`, and vice versa.\n   - **Return Value:** Finally, `dummy.next` (the node after the dummy node) is returned, which is the actual head of the merged sorted list.\n\n3. **Example Usage:**  The example shows how to create linked lists and use the `mergeTwoLists` function. The `while` loop at the end prints the values of the nodes in the merged list.\n\n\nThis solution uses a concise and efficient approach to merge the sorted lists with a time complexity of O(m + n), where 'm' and 'n' are the lengths of the input lists, and a space complexity of O(1) (constant space).  The use of a dummy node significantly improves the code's readability and simplifies the logic.\n",
  "115": "The \"Generate Parentheses\" problem requires generating all valid combinations of opening and closing parentheses given a number `n`.  A valid combination means that for every opening parenthesis, there's a corresponding closing parenthesis, and at no point are there more closing parentheses than opening parentheses.\n\nHere's a Python solution using backtracking, along with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef generateParenthesis(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates all valid combinations of n pairs of parentheses.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The number of pairs of parentheses.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of strings, where each string is a valid combination of parentheses.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    result = []\n\n    def backtrack(s='', left=0, right=0):\n        \"\"\"\n        Recursive backtracking helper function.\n\n        Args:\n            s: The current string of parentheses being built.\n            left: The number of opening parentheses used.\n            right: The number of closing parentheses used.\n        \"\"\"\n        if len(s) == 2 * n:  # Base case: string is complete\n            result.append(s)\n            return\n\n        if left < n:  # Add an opening parenthesis if we haven't used n of them\n            backtrack(s + '(', left + 1, right)\n        if right < left:  # Add a closing parenthesis if there are more open than closed\n            backtrack(s + ')', left, right + 1)\n\n    backtrack()\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nn = 3\nprint(generateParenthesis(n))  # Output: ['((()))', '(()())', '(())()', '()(())', '()()()']\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`generateParenthesis(n)` function:** This is the main function that takes the number of pairs `n` as input and returns a list of valid parentheses combinations. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the combinations.\n\n2. **`backtrack(s='', left=0, right=0)` function:** This is a recursive helper function that does the actual backtracking.\n   - `s`:  Keeps track of the currently generated string of parentheses.  Starts empty.\n   - `left`: Counts the number of opening parentheses used so far.\n   - `right`: Counts the number of closing parentheses used so far.\n\n3. **Base Case:** `if len(s) == 2 * n:`: If the length of the current string `s` is equal to `2 * n` (meaning we've used all `n` pairs), we've found a valid combination, so we append it to `result` and return.\n\n4. **Recursive Steps:**\n   - `if left < n:`: If we haven't used all the opening parentheses, we can add an opening parenthesis `(`. We recursively call `backtrack` with the updated string, `left` count incremented, and `right` count unchanged.\n   - `if right < left:`:  This crucial condition ensures that we only add a closing parenthesis `)` if the number of closing parentheses is less than the number of opening parentheses (to avoid invalid combinations like `())`).  We recursively call `backtrack` with the updated string, `left` count unchanged, and `right` count incremented.\n\n5. **Return Value:** The `generateParenthesis` function returns the `result` list containing all the valid combinations of parentheses.\n\n\nThe backtracking algorithm explores all possible combinations systematically, ensuring that only valid combinations are generated by carefully controlling the addition of opening and closing parentheses based on the `left` and `right` counters.  The algorithm's efficiency comes from avoiding invalid combinations early in the recursion, significantly reducing the search space.\n",
  "116": "The most efficient solution to the \"Merge k Sorted Lists\" problem uses a priority queue (heap).  This allows us to efficiently find the smallest element among all the k lists at each step.

If so, it returns `None`.\n   - **Heap Initialization:** Creates a min-heap `heap` using `heapq`.  The heap stores tuples of the form `(val, i, node)`, where:\n     - `val`: The value of the current node.\n     - `i`: The index of the list the node belongs to.  This is crucial for tracking which list to pull the next node from.\n     - `node`: The `ListNode` object itself.\n     It iterates through the input lists, adding the first node of each non-empty list to the heap.\n   - **Merging:**  Uses a `while` loop to iteratively extract the smallest node from the heap using `heapq.heappop()`.\n     - The smallest node is appended to the merged list.\n     - If the extracted node has a `next` node (meaning the list it came from isn't exhausted), the `next` node is added to the heap. This maintains the heap's sorted property.\n   - **Dummy Node:** A dummy node (`dummy`) is used to simplify the code.  It makes it easier to build the merged list without handling edge cases for the first node. The actual head of the merged list is `dummy.next`.\n\n\n3. **Example Usage:** Creates three sample sorted linked lists and demonstrates how to use the `mergeKLists` function.  The resulting merged list is then printed.\n\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(N log k), where N is the total number of nodes in all k lists, and k is the number of lists.  This is because each node is added and removed from the heap once (log k time complexity for heap operations), and there are N nodes in total.\n\n- **Space Complexity:** O(k). The space used by the heap is proportional to the number of lists (k), as at most one node from each list will be in the heap at any time.\n\n\nThis heap-based approach is significantly more efficient than other naive approaches (e.g., merging pairwise) for larger values of k.  The use of a min-heap guarantees that we always find the smallest element efficiently, leading to an optimal solution.\n",

In these cases, no swapping is needed, and the original head is returned.\n\n3. **Dummy Node:** A dummy node is created. This simplifies the handling of the first pair of nodes.  It points to the original head.\n\n4. **Iteration:** The `while` loop iterates as long as there are at least two nodes remaining to be swapped (`prev.next and prev.next.next`).\n\n5. **Node Assignment:**  Inside the loop:\n   - `first` and `second` point to the first and second nodes of the pair to be swapped.\n   - The `prev.next` pointer is reassigned to point to `second` (making `second` the new node after `prev`).\n   - `first.next` is set to `second.next` (connecting `first` to the rest of the list after the swap).\n   - `second.next` is set to `first` (completing the swap).\n\n\n6. **Pointer Advancement:** `prev` is moved two steps forward to point to the node before the next pair to be swapped.\n\n7. **Return Value:** Finally, `dummy.next` (the node after the dummy node) is returned, which is the new head of the swapped list.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\n# Create a linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5\nhead = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))))\n\nswapped_head = swapPairs(head)\n\n# Print the swapped list\nwhile swapped_head:\n    print(swapped_head.val, end=\" \")\n    swapped_head = swapped_head.next\n# Output: 2 1 4 3 5\n\n```\n\nThis solution efficiently swaps nodes in pairs using only pointer manipulation, adhering to the problem constraints.  The use of a dummy node significantly simplifies the code and avoids special handling for the first pair.\n",

This avoids special cases when reversing the very first group.\n   - `group_prev` points to the node before the current group being reversed.\n   - The `while True` loop iterates through the list, reversing groups of `k` nodes at a time.\n   - `get_kth(group_prev, k)` finds the k-th node from `group_prev`. If it returns `None`, it means there are fewer than `k` nodes remaining, and the loop terminates.\n   - `reverse(group_prev, kth)` reverses the current k-group.\n   - The reversed group is then connected to the previous and next groups.\n   - `group_prev` is updated to point to the beginning of the next group.\n\n3. **`get_kth(curr, k)`:**  This helper function efficiently finds the k-th node from a given node.\n\n4. **`reverse(prev, end)`:** This helper function reverses a sub-list between `prev` and `end` (inclusive of `end`). It uses iterative reversal, which is generally more efficient than recursive reversal for linked lists.  It cleverly uses three pointers (`curr`, `nxt`, `prev`) to manage the links during reversal.\n\nThe code effectively breaks down the problem into smaller, manageable sub-problems (finding the k-th node, reversing a sub-list), making the solution clear and easier to understand.  The use of a dummy node and helper functions greatly improves the code's readability and maintainability.\n",

It starts at index 1.\n\n3. **Iteration and Comparison:** The `while` loop continues as long as `fast` is within the bounds of the array. Inside the loop:\n   - `nums[fast] != nums[slow]` checks if the current element (`nums[fast]`) is different from the last unique element found (`nums[slow]`).\n   - If they are different, it means we've found a new unique element.  We increment `slow` to point to the next position for a unique element, and then copy the value from `nums[fast]` to `nums[slow]`, effectively overwriting the duplicate.\n   - Regardless of whether the elements are the same or different, `fast` is incremented to move to the next element.\n\n4. **Return Value:** After the loop finishes, `slow + 1` represents the number of unique elements in the array (because `slow` points to the last unique element's index).  The function returns this count.  Importantly, the original `nums` array has been modified in-place; the first `slow+1` elements now contain the unique elements.\n\n\nThis two-pointer approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, because we iterate through the array once. The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.  This makes it a very efficient solution for this problem.\n",
  "120": "The \"Remove Element\" problem asks us to efficiently remove all instances of a specific value from an array and return the new length of the array without the removed values. We're allowed to change the order of the remaining elements.  An in-place solution is preferred, meaning we shouldn't create a new array; we modify the existing one.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef remove_element(nums, val):\n    \"\"\"\n    Removes all occurrences of val in nums in-place and returns the new length.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A list of integers.\n        val: The integer value to remove.\n\n    Returns:\n        The number of elements in nums that are not equal to val.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Two-pointer approach:\n    # k keeps track of the index where the next non-val element should be placed.\n    # i iterates through the entire array.\n\n    k = 0  # Index for the next non-val element\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] != val:\n            nums[k] = nums[i]  # Place the non-val element at index k\n            k += 1  # Increment k to point to the next position\n\n    return k  # k now represents the number of elements not equal to val\n\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [3, 2, 2, 3]\nval = 3\nk = remove_element(nums, val)\nprint(f\"The number of elements not equal to {val} is: {k}\")  # Output: 2\nprint(f\"The modified array is: {nums[:k]}\")  # Output: [2, 2]\n\n\nnums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2]\nval = 2\nk = remove_element(nums, val)\nprint(f\"The number of elements not equal to {val} is: {k}\")  # Output: 5\nprint(f\"The modified array is: {nums[:k]}\") # Output: [0, 1, 3, 0, 4]\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**  `k` is initialized to 0. This variable will track the index where the next element that is *not* equal to `val` should be placed.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through the `nums` array using a `for` loop and index `i`.\n\n3. **Conditional Check:** Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `nums[i]` is *not* equal to `val`.\n\n4. **In-place Replacement:** If `nums[i]` is different from `val`, it means we want to keep this element.  The code then places this element at index `k` in the array using `nums[k] = nums[i]`.  This effectively overwrites any occurrences of `val` with the non-`val` elements.\n\n5. **Incrementing `k`:** After placing a non-`val` element, `k` is incremented to point to the next available position for another non-`val` element.\n\n6. **Return Value:** After the loop completes, `k` holds the count of elements that are not equal to `val`, which is also the new effective length of the array (without the removed elements).  The function returns `k`.\n\n\nThis solution is efficient because it runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the input array, and it uses O(1) space complexity (constant extra space), fulfilling the in-place requirement.  It avoids creating a new array, making it memory-efficient for large input arrays.\n",
  "121": "The \"Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock\" problem can be solved efficiently using a single pass through the `prices` array.  We don't need to explore all possible buy/sell combinations, which would be an O(n^2) solution.  Instead, we can track the minimum price seen so far and calculate the maximum profit dynamically.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef max_profit(prices):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the maximum profit from buying and selling a stock once.\n\n    Args:\n        prices: A list of integers representing stock prices on consecutive days.\n\n    Returns:\n        The maximum profit achievable, or 0 if no profit is possible.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    if not prices:  # Handle empty input\n        return 0\n\n    min_price_so_far = prices[0]  # Initialize minimum price to the first price\n    max_profit_so_far = 0       # Initialize maximum profit to 0\n\n    for price in prices:\n        # Update the minimum price seen so far\n        min_price_so_far = min(min_price_so_far, price)\n\n        # Calculate the potential profit if we sell at the current price\n        potential_profit = price - min_price_so_far\n\n        # Update the maximum profit if the potential profit is greater\n        max_profit_so_far = max(max_profit_so_far, potential_profit)\n\n    return max_profit_so_far\n\n#Example Usage\nprices1 = [7,1,5,3,6,4]\nprint(f\"Maximum profit for {prices1}: {max_profit(prices1)}\") # Output: 5\n\nprices2 = [7,6,4,3,1]\nprint(f\"Maximum profit for {prices2}: {max_profit(prices2)}\") # Output: 0\n\nprices3 = [1]\nprint(f\"Maximum profit for {prices3}: {max_profit(prices3)}\") # Output: 0\n\nprices4 = []\nprint(f\"Maximum profit for {prices4}: {max_profit(prices4)}\") # Output: 0\n\nprices5 = [2,4,1]\nprint(f\"Maximum profit for {prices5}: {max_profit(prices5)}\") # Output: 2\n\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `min_price_so_far`: Stores the minimum stock price encountered so far. It's initialized to the first price in the `prices` list.\n   - `max_profit_so_far`: Stores the maximum profit obtained so far. It's initialized to 0.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - The code iterates through the `prices` list.\n   - In each iteration:\n     - `min_price_so_far` is updated to the minimum between the current `min_price_so_far` and the current `price`. This ensures we always have the lowest price encountered up to the current day.\n     - `potential_profit` is calculated by subtracting `min_price_so_far` from the current `price`.  This represents the profit if we were to sell at the current price.\n     - `max_profit_so_far` is updated to the maximum between the current `max_profit_so_far` and `potential_profit`. This ensures we track the highest profit found so far.\n\n3. **Return Value:**\n   - Finally, the function returns `max_profit_so_far`, which represents the maximum profit achievable by buying and selling the stock once.\n\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n) because it iterates through the `prices` array only once. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses only a few constant extra variables.  This makes it a very efficient solution for this problem.\n",
  "122": "The \"Contains Duplicate\" problem can be solved efficiently using a few different approaches in Python.  Here's a solution using a set, along with a detailed explanation and comparison to other methods:\n\n**Solution using a Set:**\n\n```python\ndef containsDuplicate(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if an array contains duplicate elements.\n\n    Args:\n      nums: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n      True if the array contains at least one duplicate element, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    seen = set()  # Use a set to efficiently track seen numbers\n    for num in nums:\n        if num in seen:\n            return True  # Found a duplicate\n        seen.add(num)  # Add the number to the set\n    return False  # No duplicates found\n\n\n# Example usage:\nnums1 = [1, 2, 3, 1]\nprint(f\"Contains duplicates (nums1): {containsDuplicate(nums1)}\")  # Output: True\n\nnums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nprint(f\"Contains duplicates (nums2): {containsDuplicate(nums2)}\")  # Output: False\n\nnums3 = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]\nprint(f\"Contains duplicates (nums3): {containsDuplicate(nums3)}\") # Output: True\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Set Initialization:** We create an empty set called `seen`. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.  The key advantage of using a set here is that checking for membership (`num in seen`) is very efficient (approximately O(1) on average).\n\n2. **Iteration:** We iterate through the input list `nums`.\n\n3. **Membership Check:** For each number `num`, we check if it's already present in the `seen` set.  If it is, we immediately know we have a duplicate and return `True`.\n\n4. **Adding to Set:** If the number is not in `seen`, we add it to the set using `seen.add(num)`. This ensures that we keep track of all the numbers we've encountered so far.\n\n5. **No Duplicates:** If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it means all numbers are unique, and we return `False`.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input list.  We iterate through the list once.  Set lookups (`num in seen`) are on average O(1).\n\n* **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case.  The `seen` set could potentially store all n elements if there are no duplicates.\n\n\n**Alternative Approaches (Less Efficient):**\n\n* **Sorting:** You could sort the list and then check for consecutive identical elements. This would have a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step.\n\n* **Nested Loops:**  A brute-force approach using nested loops to compare each element to every other element would have a time complexity of O(n^2), making it significantly less efficient for larger input lists.\n\n\nThe set-based solution presented above is the most efficient approach for this problem in terms of both time and space complexity, making it the preferred method.\n",
  "123": "Several Python solutions exist for reversing a string. Here are three, with explanations focusing on efficiency and readability:\n\n**Solution 1: Slicing**\n\nThis is arguably the most Pythonic and efficient approach.  Python's slicing capabilities allow for concise string reversal.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_string_slicing(s):\n  \"\"\"Reverses a string using slicing.\n\n  Args:\n    s: The input string.\n\n  Returns:\n    The reversed string.\n  \"\"\"\n  return s[::-1]\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"hello\"\nreversed_string = reverse_string_slicing(input_string)\nprint(f\"The reversed string of '{input_string}' is: '{reversed_string}'\")  # Output: olleh\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* `[::-1]` is a slice that creates a reversed copy of the string.  It starts at the end of the string (implicit start index), goes to the beginning (implicit end index), and uses a step of -1 to iterate backward. This method is highly efficient because it leverages Python's optimized string operations.  It operates in O(n) time complexity (linear time, where n is the length of the string), and O(n) space complexity (linear space, as it creates a new reversed string).\n\n\n**Solution 2: `reversed()` and `join()`**\n\nThis approach uses the built-in `reversed()` function, which returns an iterator yielding characters in reverse order, and the `join()` method to concatenate them back into a string.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_string_reversed(s):\n  \"\"\"Reverses a string using reversed() and join().\n\n  Args:\n    s: The input string.\n\n  Returns:\n    The reversed string.\n  \"\"\"\n  return \"\".join(reversed(s))\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"hello\"\nreversed_string = reverse_string_reversed(input_string)\nprint(f\"The reversed string of '{input_string}' is: '{reversed_string}'\") # Output: olleh\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* `reversed(s)` creates an iterator that yields characters of `s` in reverse order.\n* `\"\".join(...)` concatenates the characters from the iterator into a new string using an empty string as a separator.  This method is also efficient, with O(n) time and O(n) space complexity.  It's slightly less concise than slicing but might be easier to understand for beginners.\n\n\n**Solution 3: For Loop (Less Efficient)**\n\nWhile functional, this approach is less efficient than the previous two. It's included for completeness and to illustrate a more explicit iterative method.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_string_loop(s):\n  \"\"\"Reverses a string using a for loop.\n\n  Args:\n    s: The input string.\n\n  Returns:\n    The reversed string.\n  \"\"\"\n  reversed_s = \"\"\n  for i in range(len(s) - 1, -1, -1):\n    reversed_s += s[i]\n  return reversed_s\n\n# Example usage\ninput_string = \"hello\"\nreversed_string = reverse_string_loop(input_string)\nprint(f\"The reversed string of '{input_string}' is: '{reversed_string}'\") # Output: olleh\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n* This method iterates through the string from the last character to the first using a `for` loop and string concatenation (`+=`).  String concatenation in a loop is less efficient than the previous methods because it creates new string objects in each iteration. This leads to O(n^2) time complexity in the worst case (due to repeated string copying),  while space complexity remains O(n).  Therefore, it's generally less preferable than slicing or using `reversed()` and `join()`.\n\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nFor reversing strings in Python, the slicing method (`[::-1]`) is the most concise and efficient.  The `reversed()` and `join()` method is a close second, offering slightly better readability for those unfamiliar with slicing.  Avoid the for loop approach unless you have a specific reason to iterate explicitly.  The choice depends on personal preference and the context of the problem; however, prioritizing efficiency generally favors slicing.\n",
  "124": "The most efficient approach to solving the \"First Unique Character in a String\" problem involves using a dictionary (or hash map) to store character counts and then iterating through the string only once.  This gives us a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef first_unique_character(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index of the first non-repeating character in a string.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The input string.\n\n    Returns:\n        The index of the first non-repeating character, or -1 if all characters are repeating.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    char_counts = {}  # Dictionary to store character counts\n\n    # Count character occurrences\n    for char in s:\n        char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1\n\n    # Find the first character with count 1\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char_counts[char] == 1:\n            return i\n\n    return -1  # All characters are repeating\n\n\n# Example usage\nstring1 = \"leetcode\"\nstring2 = \"loveleetcode\"\nstring3 = \"aabbcc\"\nstring4 = \"\" #Test for empty string\n\nprint(f\"First unique character index in '{string1}': {first_unique_character(string1)}\")  # Output: 3\nprint(f\"First unique character index in '{string2}': {first_unique_character(string2)}\")  # Output: 2\nprint(f\"First unique character index in '{string3}': {first_unique_character(string3)}\")  # Output: -1\nprint(f\"First unique character index in '{string4}': {first_unique_character(string4)}\")  # Output: -1\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`char_counts = {}`:** We initialize an empty dictionary `char_counts` to store the frequency of each character in the input string.\n\n2. **`for char in s:`:** We iterate through the input string `s` character by character.\n\n3. **`char_counts[char] = char_counts.get(char, 0) + 1`:** For each character, we update its count in the `char_counts` dictionary.  The `get(char, 0)` method safely handles cases where a character is encountered for the first time (it returns 0 if the character is not yet in the dictionary).  We then increment the count by 1.\n\n4. **`for i, char in enumerate(s):`:** We iterate through the string again using `enumerate` to get both the index (`i`) and the character (`char`).\n\n5. **`if char_counts[char] == 1:`:**  Inside the second loop, we check if the count of the current character is 1. If it is, it means this is the first non-repeating character. We return its index `i`.\n\n6. **`return -1`:** If the loop completes without finding a character with a count of 1, it means all characters are repeating, so we return -1.\n\nThis solution is efficient because it uses a dictionary for constant-time lookups (on average), making the overall time complexity O(n) for both counting and finding the first unique character.  The space complexity is O(m), where m is the number of unique characters in the string (which is at most the length of the string).  This is generally better than nested loops which would have a time complexity of O(n^2).\n",
  "125": "The most efficient solution to the Linked List Cycle problem uses Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm.  This algorithm requires only constant extra space (O(1)).\n\n**Python Solution:**\n\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, x):\n        self.val = x\n        self.next = None\n\ndef hasCycle(head):\n    \"\"\"\n    Detects if a linked list has a cycle using Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        head: The head of the linked list.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the linked list has a cycle, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not head or not head.next:  # Empty list or single node, no cycle\n        return False\n\n    tortoise = head  # Slow pointer\n    hare = head.next  # Fast pointer\n\n    while tortoise != hare:\n        if not hare or not hare.next:  # No cycle if fast pointer reaches the end\n            return False\n        tortoise = tortoise.next\n        hare = hare.next.next\n\n    return True  # Cycle detected\n\n\n# Example Usage\nhead = ListNode(3)\nhead.next = ListNode(2)\nhead.next.next = ListNode(0)\nhead.next.next.next = ListNode(-4)\nhead.next.next.next.next = head.next  # Create a cycle\n\nprint(f\"List has cycle: {hasCycle(head)}\") # Output: List has cycle: True\n\n\nhead2 = ListNode(1)\nhead2.next = ListNode(2)\nhead2.next.next = ListNode(3)\n\nprint(f\"List has cycle: {hasCycle(head2)}\") # Output: List has cycle: False\n```\n\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `tortoise` (slow pointer) starts at the head of the linked list.\n   - `hare` (fast pointer) starts at the node after the head.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - The `while tortoise != hare` loop continues until the slow and fast pointers meet.\n   - In each iteration:\n     - The `tortoise` moves one step forward (`tortoise = tortoise.next`).\n     - The `hare` moves two steps forward (`hare = hare.next.next`).\n\n3. **Cycle Detection:**\n   - If the linked list has a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually lap the slow pointer, and they will meet at some point within the cycle.\n   - If the linked list does not have a cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list (`None`), and the loop will terminate.  We handle this by explicitly checking `if not hare or not hare.next`.\n\n4. **Return Value:**\n   - If `tortoise == hare`, a cycle is detected, and the function returns `True`.\n   - Otherwise, the function returns `False`.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.  In the worst case (no cycle), the fast pointer will traverse the entire list.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The algorithm uses only a constant amount of extra space to store the `tortoise` and `hare` pointers.  This is why it's preferred over solutions that use sets or other data structures to track visited nodes.\n\n\nFloyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm is a clever and efficient way to detect cycles in a linked list without using extra space, making it a valuable technique for solving this type of problem.\n",
  "126": "The problem can be solved efficiently using a combination of tree traversal and string comparison. We'll serialize the trees into strings and then check if the serialized form of `root2` is a substring of the serialized form of `root1`.

The comma is crucial to avoid false positives (e.g., \"12\" being a substring of \"123\" but not representing a valid subtree).\n\n4. **String Comparison:** The core logic lies in comparing the serialized strings.  If the serialized string of `root2` is a substring of the serialized string of `root1`, it implies that `root2` is a subtree of `root1`.  The `in` operator efficiently performs this substring check.\n\n5. **Example Usage:** The code demonstrates several test cases to showcase the functionality of the `isSubtree` function, including cases with empty trees and trees where the subtree is not a perfect match\n\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n* **Time Complexity:** O(M * N), where M is the number of nodes in `root1` and N is the number of nodes in `root2`.  Serialization takes O(M) and O(N) time respectively, and the substring check in the worst case takes O(M*N) time.\n\n* **Space Complexity:** O(M + N) in the worst case, due to the recursive calls in `serialize` and the space used to store the serialized strings.\n\n\nThis solution provides a clear, concise, and efficient way to solve the Subtree of Another Tree problem.  The use of string serialization simplifies the comparison significantly compared to a purely recursive approach that would involve a potentially large number of node-by-node comparisons.\n",

Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `low`:  Initially set to 0, representing the index of the first element.\n   - `high`: Initially set to `len(arr) - 1`, representing the index of the last element.\n\n2. **Iteration:**\n   - The `while low <= high` loop continues as long as the search space (the portion of the array between `low` and `high`) is non-empty.\n\n3. **Midpoint Calculation:**\n   - `mid = (low + high) // 2`:  The middle index is calculated using integer division (`//`). This ensures that `mid` is always an integer.\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - `if arr[mid] == target`: If the element at the middle index matches the target, the target is found, and the function returns `True`.\n   - `elif arr[mid] < target`: If the element at the middle index is less than the target, the target must be in the right half of the array.  Therefore, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.\n   - `else`: If the element at the middle index is greater than the target, the target must be in the left half of the array. Therefore, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.\n\n5. **Target Not Found:**\n   - If the loop completes without finding the target (i.e., `low` becomes greater than `high`), it means the target is not present in the array, and the function returns `False`.\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.  This is because the search space is halved in each iteration.\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.  This makes it very memory-efficient.\n\n**Important Note:** Binary search only works correctly on *sorted* arrays. If the input array is not sorted, the algorithm will not produce the correct result.  You would need to sort the array first before applying binary search.\n",
  "128": "The Majority Element problem can be solved efficiently using several approaches. Here, we'll explore two common methods: using a hash map (dictionary in Python) and using Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.\n\n**Method 1: Hash Map (Dictionary)**\n\nThis approach involves counting the occurrences of each element in the input array using a dictionary.  The element with a count greater than `n/2` is the majority element.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef majorityElement_hashmap(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the majority element using a hash map.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The majority element.\n    \"\"\"\n    counts = Counter(nums)  #Efficiently counts element occurrences\n    n = len(nums)\n    for num, count in counts.items():\n        if count > n // 2:\n            return num\n\n# Example usage:\nnums1 = [3, 2, 3]\nnums2 = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nprint(f\"Majority element in {nums1}: {majorityElement_hashmap(nums1)}\")  # Output: 3\nprint(f\"Majority element in {nums2}: {majorityElement_hashmap(nums2)}\")  # Output: 2\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`Counter(nums)`:** This line utilizes Python's `Counter` object from the `collections` module.  `Counter` efficiently creates a dictionary where keys are the unique elements from `nums`, and values are their respective counts.\n\n2. **Iteration and Check:** The code then iterates through the `counts` dictionary. For each element and its count, it checks if the count is greater than `n // 2` (integer division).  If it is, that element is the majority element, and the function immediately returns it.\n\n**Method 2: Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm**\n\nThis algorithm is significantly more efficient in terms of space complexity (O(1) vs O(n) for the hash map approach).  It works by canceling out elements that are not the majority element.\n\n```python\ndef majorityElement_boyermoore(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the majority element using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The majority element.\n    \"\"\"\n    candidate = None\n    count = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if count == 0:\n            candidate = num\n        count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)\n    return candidate\n\n# Example Usage\nnums1 = [3, 2, 3]\nnums2 = [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]\nprint(f\"Majority element in {nums1}: {majorityElement_boyermoore(nums1)}\")  # Output: 3\nprint(f\"Majority element in {nums2}: {majorityElement_boyermoore(nums2)}\")  # Output: 2\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** `candidate` keeps track of the potential majority element, initialized to `None`. `count` tracks the count of the current `candidate`.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The algorithm iterates through the array.\n\n3. **Candidate Update:** If `count` is 0, it means that the current `candidate` is not the majority element (or we've encountered a new potential candidate), so we set the `candidate` to the current element (`num`).\n\n4. **Count Update:**  If the current element is the same as the `candidate`, we increment `count`; otherwise, we decrement it.  This essentially cancels out non-majority elements.\n\n5. **Return:** After iterating through the entire array, the `candidate` will hold the majority element.\n\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n| Method             | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |\n|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Hash Map           | O(n)            | O(n)             |\n| Boyer-Moore Voting | O(n)            | O(1)             |\n\nThe Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm is preferred when memory efficiency is crucial, especially for very large input arrays.  The hash map approach is simpler to understand but less efficient in terms of space.  Both have a linear time complexity.\n",
  "129": "The \"Move Zeroes\" problem can be efficiently solved in Python using a two-pointer approach.  This avoids the need for extra space (in-place) and maintains the relative order of non-zero elements.\n\n**Python Solution:**\n\n```python\ndef move_zeroes(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Moves all 0's to the end of the input array nums in-place,\n    preserving the relative order of non-zero elements.\n\n    Args:\n      nums: A list of integers.\n    \"\"\"\n    zero_index = 0  # Pointer for the next position to place a zero\n\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] != 0:\n            # If the current element is non-zero, swap it with the element\n            # at the zero_index and increment zero_index\n            nums[i], nums[zero_index] = nums[zero_index], nums[i]\n            zero_index += 1\n\n\n#Example Usage\nnums1 = [0,1,0,3,12]\nmove_zeroes(nums1)\nprint(f\"After moving zeroes: {nums1}\") # Output: After moving zeroes: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]\n\nnums2 = [0]\nmove_zeroes(nums2)\nprint(f\"After moving zeroes: {nums2}\") # Output: After moving zeroes: [0]\n\nnums3 = [1,0]\nmove_zeroes(nums3)\nprint(f\"After moving zeroes: {nums3}\") # Output: After moving zeroes: [1, 0]\n\nnums4 = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 3, 12]\nmove_zeroes(nums4)\nprint(f\"After moving zeroes: {nums4}\") # Output: After moving zeroes: [1, 1, 3, 12, 0, 0, 0]\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** We initialize `zero_index` to 0. This variable keeps track of the index where the next zero should be placed.  It essentially represents the boundary between non-zero elements and the yet-to-be-filled zero portion of the array.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through the input array `nums`.\n\n3. **Conditional Check:** Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `nums[i]` is non-zero.\n\n4. **Swap Operation:** If `nums[i]` is non-zero, it means we've found a non-zero element that shouldn't be at its current position.  We swap it with the element at `zero_index`.  This effectively moves the non-zero element to its correct position (before the zero section), and the zero element is moved to a position that will eventually be overwritten.\n\n5. **Increment `zero_index`:** After the swap, `zero_index` is incremented because we've successfully placed another non-zero element.\n\n6. **In-place Modification:** The swapping happens directly within the `nums` array; no new array is created.  This satisfies the \"in-place\" requirement.\n\n7. **Implicit Zero Placement:**  After the loop completes, all non-zero elements are in their correct positions at the beginning of the array. The remaining elements (from `zero_index` to the end) are implicitly zeros because they haven't been overwritten by any non-zero elements during the swapping process.\n\n\nThis two-pointer approach is efficient because it iterates through the array only once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses only a constant amount of extra space.\n",
  "130": "The \"Missing Number\" problem can be solved in several ways.  Here are two Python solutions with explanations:\n\n**Method 1: Using the mathematical formula for the sum of an arithmetic series**\n\nThis method is efficient because it avoids iteration over the array. It leverages the fact that the sum of numbers from 0 to n is given by the formula n(n+1)/2.\n\n```python\ndef missingNumber_sum(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the missing number in an array using the sum of arithmetic series.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A list of integers from 0 to n, with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n        The missing integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums)\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2  # Integer division to avoid floating-point issues\n    actual_sum = sum(nums)\n    return expected_sum - actual_sum\n\n\n# Example Usage\nnums1 = [3, 0, 1]\nprint(f\"Missing number in {nums1}: {missingNumber_sum(nums1)}\")  # Output: 2\n\nnums2 = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(f\"Missing number in {nums2}: {missingNumber_sum(nums2)}\")  # Output: 3\n\nnums3 = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]\nprint(f\"Missing number in {nums3}: {missingNumber_sum(nums3)}\") #Output: 8\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Calculate the expected sum:**  We first determine the expected sum of numbers from 0 to `n` (where `n` is the length of the input array) using the formula `n * (n + 1) // 2`.  Integer division (`//`) is crucial to ensure an integer result.\n\n2. **Calculate the actual sum:** We then calculate the sum of the numbers present in the input array `nums` using the built-in `sum()` function.\n\n3. **Find the difference:** The difference between the `expected_sum` and the `actual_sum` is the missing number.\n\n**Method 2: Using a set for efficient lookup**\n\nThis method uses a set for faster lookup. It's particularly beneficial for larger arrays.\n\n```python\ndef missingNumber_set(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the missing number in an array using a set for efficient lookup.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A list of integers from 0 to n, with one number missing.\n\n    Returns:\n        The missing integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(nums)\n    num_set = set(nums)\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        if i not in num_set:\n            return i\n\n\n# Example Usage\nnums1 = [3, 0, 1]\nprint(f\"Missing number in {nums1}: {missingNumber_set(nums1)}\")  # Output: 2\n\nnums2 = [0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]\nprint(f\"Missing number in {nums2}: {missingNumber_set(nums2)}\")  # Output: 3\n\nnums3 = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]\nprint(f\"Missing number in {nums3}: {missingNumber_set(nums3)}\") #Output: 8\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Create a set:** We convert the input list `nums` into a set (`num_set`). Sets provide O(1) lookup time, making the search very efficient.\n\n2. **Iterate and check:** We iterate from 0 to `n` (inclusive). For each number, we check if it's present in the `num_set`. If a number is not found, it's the missing number, and we return it.\n\n**Choosing the best method:**\n\n* For smaller arrays, the mathematical approach (Method 1) might be slightly faster due to its minimal overhead.\n* For larger arrays, the set-based approach (Method 2) will be significantly faster because set lookups are much more efficient than iterating through a list.  The time complexity of Method 1 is O(n) while Method 2 is also O(n) but with a potentially smaller constant factor due to the efficiency of set lookups.  The space complexity of Method 2 is O(n) while Method 1 is O(1).\n",
  "131": "The problem asks for the intersection of two arrays, meaning we need to find the elements that are present in both `nums1` and `nums2`.  The solution below uses sets for efficiency.\n\n**Python Solution:**\n\n```python\ndef intersection(nums1, nums2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the intersection of two arrays.\n\n    Args:\n        nums1: The first integer array.\n        nums2: The second integer array.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing the unique elements that are present in both input arrays.  Returns an empty list if there's no intersection.\n    \"\"\"\n    set1 = set(nums1)  # Convert to sets for efficient intersection operation\n    set2 = set(nums2)\n    intersection_set = set1.intersection(set2)  # Efficient set intersection\n    return list(intersection_set)  # Convert back to a list for the result\n\n\n#Example Usage\nnums1 = [1, 2, 2, 1]\nnums2 = [2, 2]\nprint(f\"Intersection of {nums1} and {nums2}: {intersection(nums1, nums2)}\")  # Output: [2]\n\nnums1 = [4,9,5]\nnums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]\nprint(f\"Intersection of {nums1} and {nums2}: {intersection(nums1, nums2)}\") # Output: [9, 4]\n\nnums1 = [1,2,3]\nnums2 = [4,5,6]\nprint(f\"Intersection of {nums1} and {nums2}: {intersection(nums1, nums2)}\") # Output: []\n\n```\n\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Convert to Sets:** The code first converts both input arrays (`nums1` and `nums2`) into sets using `set(nums1)` and `set(nums2)`. Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.  This conversion is crucial for efficiency.\n\n2. **Set Intersection:**  The core of the solution is the `intersection()` method of sets.  `set1.intersection(set2)` efficiently finds the common elements between `set1` and `set2`. The result is a new set containing only the unique elements present in both original sets.  This operation is significantly faster than iterating through the arrays directly, especially for larger arrays.\n\n3. **Convert back to List:** Finally, the resulting intersection set is converted back into a list using `list(intersection_set)` because the problem specifies that the output should be an array (list in Python).\n\n**Why Sets are Efficient:**\n\nSets provide O(1) (constant time) average-case complexity for membership checking (`in` operator) and intersection operations.  In contrast, checking for element presence in a list requires O(n) (linear time) on average, where n is the length of the list.  For larger arrays, this difference in efficiency becomes substantial.  Therefore, using sets is the preferred approach for this problem to optimize performance.\n",
  "132": "The solution uses a dictionary to count character frequencies in the magazine and then checks if the ransom note's character frequencies are less than or equal to the magazine's frequencies.  This approach is efficient because dictionary lookups are O(1) on average.\n\n```python\ndef can_construct_ransom_note(ransom_note, magazine):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if a ransom note can be constructed from a magazine.\n\n    Args:\n        ransom_note: The string representing the ransom note.\n        magazine: The string representing the magazine.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the ransom note can be constructed, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    magazine_chars = {}  # Dictionary to store character frequencies in the magazine\n\n    # Count character frequencies in the magazine\n    for char in magazine:\n        magazine_chars[char] = magazine_chars.get(char, 0) + 1\n\n    # Check if ransom note can be constructed\n    for char in ransom_note:\n        if char not in magazine_chars or magazine_chars[char] == 0:\n            return False  # Character not found or already used\n        magazine_chars[char] -= 1\n\n    return True  # Ransom note can be constructed\n\n\n# Example usage\nransom_note1 = \"aa\"\nmagazine1 = \"aab\"\nprint(f\"Can construct ransom note '{ransom_note1}' from magazine '{magazine1}': {can_construct_ransom_note(ransom_note1, magazine1)}\")  # Output: True\n\nransom_note2 = \"aa\"\nmagazine2 = \"ab\"\nprint(f\"Can construct ransom note '{ransom_note2}' from magazine '{magazine2}': {can_construct_ransom_note(ransom_note2, magazine2)}\")  # Output: False\n\nransom_note3 = \"a\"\nmagazine3 = \"\"\nprint(f\"Can construct ransom note '{ransom_note3}' from magazine '{magazine3}': {can_construct_ransom_note(ransom_note3, magazine3)}\")  # Output: False\n\nransom_note4 = \"\"\nmagazine4 = \"abc\"\nprint(f\"Can construct ransom note '{ransom_note4}' from magazine '{magazine4}': {can_construct_ransom_note(ransom_note4, magazine4)}\")  # Output: True\n\nransom_note5 = \"bg\"\nmagazine5 = \"efghijb\"\nprint(f\"Can construct ransom note '{ransom_note5}' from magazine '{magazine5}': {can_construct_ransom_note(ransom_note5, magazine5)}\") #Output: True\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** A dictionary `magazine_chars` is created to store the frequency of each character in the `magazine` string.  The `get(char, 0)` method ensures that if a character is not yet in the dictionary, it's added with a count of 0 before incrementing.\n\n2. **Magazine Character Counting:** The code iterates through the `magazine` string. For each character, it updates its count in `magazine_chars`.\n\n3. **Ransom Note Check:** The code iterates through the `ransom_note` string. For each character:\n   - It checks if the character exists as a key in `magazine_chars`. If not, it means the character is not in the magazine, so the function immediately returns `False`.\n   - If the character exists, it checks if its count (`magazine_chars[char]`) is greater than 0. If it's 0, it means the character has already been used up from the magazine, so the function returns `False`.\n   - If the character is found and its count is greater than 0, the count is decremented (`magazine_chars[char] -= 1`), indicating that this character from the magazine has been used.\n\n4. **Success:** If the loop completes without finding any missing or used-up characters, it means the ransom note can be constructed using characters from the magazine, and the function returns `True`.\n\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(m + n), where m is the length of the magazine and n is the length of the ransom note.  The space complexity is O(1) in the worst case (because there are only 26 lowercase English letters), making it very efficient for this problem.\n",
  "133": "Several Python solutions exist for the FizzBuzz problem, each with varying degrees of efficiency and readability. Here are two solutions, one straightforward and one slightly more optimized:\n\n\n**Solution 1: Straightforward Approach**\n\nThis solution uses a series of `if/elif/else` statements to handle each condition explicitly.  It's easy to understand and follows the problem description directly.\n\n```python\ndef fizzbuzz(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints FizzBuzz output for numbers 1 to n.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The upper limit of the range (inclusive).\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 15 == 0:\n            print(\"FizzBuzz\")\n        elif i % 3 == 0:\n            print(\"Fizz\")\n        elif i % 5 == 0:\n            print(\"Buzz\")\n        else:\n            print(i)\n\n# Example usage:\nfizzbuzz(15)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`def fizzbuzz(n):`**: This line defines a function named `fizzbuzz` that takes an integer `n` as input.\n2. **`for i in range(1, n + 1):`**: This loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive).  `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at `n`.\n3. **`if i % 15 == 0:`**: This condition checks if the number `i` is divisible by 15. If it is, \"FizzBuzz\" is printed.  We check for divisibility by 15 first because it covers cases where the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.\n4. **`elif i % 3 == 0:`**: If the number is not divisible by 15, this condition checks if it's divisible by 3. If it is, \"Fizz\" is printed.\n5. **`elif i % 5 == 0:`**: If the number is not divisible by 15 or 3, this condition checks if it's divisible by 5. If it is, \"Buzz\" is printed.\n6. **`else:`**: If none of the above conditions are met, the number `i` itself is printed.\n\n\n**Solution 2: Slightly More Concise Approach (using string concatenation)**\n\nThis solution uses string concatenation and a conditional expression to achieve a more compact result.\n\n\n```python\ndef fizzbuzz_concise(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Prints FizzBuzz output for numbers 1 to n (more concise version).\n\n    Args:\n        n: The upper limit of the range (inclusive).\n    \"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        output = \"\"\n        output += \"Fizz\" if i % 3 == 0 else \"\"\n        output += \"Buzz\" if i % 5 == 0 else \"\"\n        print(output or i)\n\n# Example usage:\nfizzbuzz_concise(15)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  An empty string `output` is initialized for each number.\n2.  Conditional expressions (`\"Fizz\" if i % 3 == 0 else \"\"`) efficiently add \"Fizz\" or nothing to `output` based on divisibility by 3.  The same logic applies for \"Buzz\" and divisibility by 5.\n3.  `print(output or i)` cleverly handles the case where `output` remains empty (meaning the number is not divisible by 3 or 5).  In that case, the `or` operator makes it print the number `i` instead.\n\nBoth solutions achieve the same result. The choice between them depends on personal preference and the context. The first solution is arguably more readable for beginners, while the second demonstrates a more concise and Pythonic approach.  For larger values of `n`, the performance difference between these two solutions is negligible.\n",
  "134": "The \"Single Number\" problem can be efficiently solved using the bitwise XOR operator (^) in Python.  This leverages the properties of XOR:\n\n* **XOR with 0:**  `x ^ 0 == x` (XORing with 0 leaves the number unchanged)\n* **Commutative and Associative:** `x ^ y == y ^ x` and `x ^ (y ^ z) == (x ^ y) ^ z`\n* **Self-Inverse:** `x ^ x == 0` (XORing a number with itself results in 0)\n\nTherefore, if we XOR all the numbers in the array, the pairs of duplicate numbers will cancel each other out (resulting in 0), leaving only the single, non-duplicate number.\n\nHere's the Python solution and a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef single_number(nums):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the single non-duplicate element in an array where all other elements appear twice.\n\n    Args:\n        nums: A list of integers.\n\n    Returns:\n        The single non-duplicate integer.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        result ^= num  # XOR each number with the current result\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nnums1 = [2, 2, 1]\nnums2 = [4, 1, 2, 1, 2]\nnums3 = [1]\n\nprint(f\"Single number in {nums1}: {single_number(nums1)}\")  # Output: 1\nprint(f\"Single number in {nums2}: {single_number(nums2)}\")  # Output: 4\nprint(f\"Single number in {nums3}: {single_number(nums3)}\")  # Output: 1\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Initialization:** `result` is initialized to 0. This acts as the starting point for our XOR operations.  Remember, XORing with 0 doesn't change the value.\n\n2. **Iteration and XOR:** The code iterates through each number (`num`) in the input list `nums`.  In each iteration, the current `num` is XORed with the current value of `result`.\n\n3. **XOR's Properties at Work:**  Because XOR is commutative and associative, the order of XOR operations doesn't matter.  Crucially, when a number appears twice, the XOR operation cancels it out: `x ^ x == 0`.  This means that duplicate numbers effectively disappear from the `result`.\n\n4. **Final Result:** After iterating through all numbers, `result` will hold the single non-duplicate number because all the duplicate pairs have XORed to 0, leaving only the unique element.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We iterate through the array once.\n* **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use a constant amount of extra space to store the `result` variable.  The algorithm is highly efficient in terms of both time and space.  This makes it a preferred solution for this problem.\n",

The `fast` pointer moves twice as fast as the `slow` pointer. When `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will be at the middle.\n\n2. **Reversing the Second Half:** The code then iteratively reverses the second half of the linked list using three pointers: `prev`, `curr`, and `next_node`. This is a standard linked list reversal algorithm.\n\n3. **Comparison:** Finally, the code compares the values of the nodes in the first half and the reversed second half. If any pair of values doesn't match, it's not a palindrome, and `False` is returned. If the entire comparison completes without finding any mismatches, it's a palindrome, and `True` is returned.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n* **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list a constant number of times (once to find the middle, once to reverse the second half, and once to compare).\n* **Space Complexity:** O(1).  The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.  We only use a few pointers.\n\n\nThis solution is efficient and avoids the need to store the entire linked list in memory, making it suitable for large linked lists.  The added handling of edge cases (empty and single-node lists) makes the code more robust.\n",
  "136": "The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes. This path may or may not pass through the root.

It uses a helper function `height`.\n\n3. **`height(node)` Function:** This recursive function calculates the height of a subtree rooted at `node`.\n\n   - **Base Case:** If `node` is `None` (empty subtree), it returns 0.\n   - **Recursive Step:** It recursively calculates the heights of the left and right subtrees.\n   - **Diameter Update:**  Crucially, it updates the `diameter` list (using `diameter[0] = max(diameter[0], left_height + right_height)`) to store the maximum diameter encountered so far.  The diameter at any node is the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees.\n   - **Height Return:** It returns the height of the current subtree (1 + max(left_height, right_height)).\n\n4. **Main Function Logic:**\n   - `diameter = [0]` initializes a list to store the maximum diameter.  We use a list because we need a mutable object to be modified within the recursive `height` function.\n   - `height(root)` is called to start the recursive calculation.  This call implicitly calculates the diameter as a side effect through the updates to `diameter[0]`.\n   - Finally, `diameter[0]` (the maximum diameter found) is returned.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.  We visit each node once.\n- **Space Complexity:** O(H) in the worst case, where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack.  In a balanced tree, H is log(N), and in a skewed tree, H is N.\n\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the diameter without needing to explicitly explore all possible paths between node pairs, making it much faster than a brute-force approach.  The clever use of the `height` function to implicitly track the diameter during the height calculation is key to its efficiency.\n",
  "137": "The problem of inverting a binary tree involves recursively swapping the left and right children of each node.  We'll use a recursive approach for a clean and efficient solution.\n\n**Python Solution:**\n\n```python\nclass TreeNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.left = left\n        self.right = right\n\ndef invertTree(root):\n    \"\"\"\n    Inverts a binary tree.\n\n    Args:\n        root: The root node of the binary tree.\n\n    Returns:\n        The root node of the inverted binary tree.\n    \"\"\"\n    if root is None:  # Base case: empty tree\n        return None\n\n    # Recursively invert the left and right subtrees\n    root.left, root.right = invertTree(root.right), invertTree(root.left)\n\n    return root\n\n# Example usage:\nroot = TreeNode(4)\nroot.left = TreeNode(2)\nroot.right = TreeNode(7)\nroot.left.left = TreeNode(1)\nroot.left.right = TreeNode(3)\nroot.right.left = TreeNode(6)\nroot.right.right = TreeNode(9)\n\n\ninverted_root = invertTree(root)\n\n# Function to print the tree (inorder traversal - for demonstration)\ndef print_tree(node):\n    if node:\n        print_tree(node.left)\n        print(node.val, end=\" \")\n        print_tree(node.right)\n\nprint(\"Original Tree (inorder):\")\nprint_tree(root)  # Output: 1 2 3 4 6 7 9\nprint(\"\\nInverted Tree (inorder):\")\nprint_tree(inverted_root) # Output: 9 7 6 4 3 2 1\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **`TreeNode` class:** This class defines the structure of a node in the binary tree, containing a value (`val`), a left child (`left`), and a right child (`right`).\n\n2. **`invertTree(root)` function:** This function recursively inverts the tree.\n\n   - **Base Case:** If the `root` is `None` (empty tree), it returns `None`. This stops the recursion.\n\n   - **Recursive Step:** The core logic is in this line:\n     ```python\n     root.left, root.right = invertTree(root.right), invertTree(root.left)\n     ```\n     It simultaneously swaps the left and right children.  It does this by:\n       - Recursively calling `invertTree` on the right subtree (`root.right`) and assigning the result to `root.left`.\n       - Recursively calling `invertTree` on the left subtree (`root.left`) and assigning the result to `root.right`.  This is done in a single line using Python's tuple assignment.\n\n   - **Return Value:** The function returns the `root` of the inverted subtree.\n\n3. **Example Usage:** The code creates a sample binary tree and then calls `invertTree` to invert it. The `print_tree` function (which uses an inorder traversal) is included to demonstrate the inversion.  Inorder traversal visits left subtree, then root, then right subtree.\n\n\nThis recursive approach elegantly handles the inversion of the entire tree.  The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, because each node is visited once. The space complexity is O(H) in the worst case, where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. In a balanced tree, H is log(N), and in a skewed tree, H is N.\n",
  "138": "The problem of determining if two strings are anagrams can be solved efficiently in several ways.  Here are two Python solutions with detailed explanations:\n\n**Solution 1: Using Counters (Most Efficient)**\n\nThis solution leverages the `collections.Counter` object, which provides a very efficient way to count the frequency of each character in a string.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef is_anagram_counter(s, t):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two strings are anagrams using collections.Counter.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The first string.\n        t: The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if s and t are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return Counter(s) == Counter(t)\n\n# Example usage\ns1 = \"anagram\"\nt1 = \"nagaram\"\nprint(f\"'{s1}' and '{t1}' are anagrams: {is_anagram_counter(s1, t1)}\")  # Output: True\n\ns2 = \"rat\"\nt2 = \"car\"\nprint(f\"'{s2}' and '{t2}' are anagrams: {is_anagram_counter(s2, t2)}\")  # Output: True\n\ns3 = \"listen\"\nt3 = \"silent\"\nprint(f\"'{s3}' and '{t3}' are anagrams: {is_anagram_counter(s3, t3)}\") # Output: True\n\ns4 = \"hello\"\nt4 = \"world\"\nprint(f\"'{s4}' and '{t4}' are anagrams: {is_anagram_counter(s4, t4)}\")  # Output: False\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Import `Counter`:** We import the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.\n2. **Create Counters:** `Counter(s)` and `Counter(t)` create dictionaries that store the frequency of each character in strings `s` and `t` respectively.  For example, `Counter(\"anagram\")` would result in `{'a': 3, 'n': 1, 'g': 1, 'r': 1, 'm': 1}`.\n3. **Compare Counters:**  The `==` operator compares the two `Counter` objects.  They are equal only if both strings have the same characters with the same frequencies.  This comparison is highly optimized within the `Counter` class.\n\n\n**Solution 2: Using Sorting (Less Efficient)**\n\nThis solution sorts the characters of both strings and then compares the sorted strings.\n\n```python\ndef is_anagram_sorting(s, t):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if two strings are anagrams using sorting.\n\n    Args:\n        s: The first string.\n        t: The second string.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if s and t are anagrams, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sorted(s) == sorted(t)\n\n# Example usage (same output as above)\ns1 = \"anagram\"\nt1 = \"nagaram\"\nprint(f\"'{s1}' and '{t1}' are anagrams: {is_anagram_sorting(s1, t1)}\")  # Output: True\n\ns2 = \"rat\"\nt2 = \"car\"\nprint(f\"'{s2}' and '{t2}' are anagrams: {is_anagram_sorting(s2, t2)}\")  # Output: True\n\ns3 = \"listen\"\nt3 = \"silent\"\nprint(f\"'{s3}' and '{t3}' are anagrams: {is_anagram_sorting(s3, t3)}\") # Output: True\n\ns4 = \"hello\"\nt4 = \"world\"\nprint(f\"'{s4}' and '{t4}' are anagrams: {is_anagram_sorting(s4, t4)}\")  # Output: False\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Sort Strings:** `sorted(s)` and `sorted(t)` sort the characters of the strings alphabetically.\n2. **Compare Sorted Strings:** The sorted strings are compared using `==`. If they are identical, the original strings are anagrams.\n\n**Which solution is better?**\n\nThe `Counter`-based solution is generally more efficient, especially for larger strings.  Sorting has a time complexity of O(n log n), while the `Counter` approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the strings.  Therefore, the `Counter` method scales better with increasing input size.  The sorting method is easier to understand for beginners but less efficient.  For most practical purposes, especially when dealing with potentially large datasets, the `Counter` approach is recommended.\n",
  "139": "The Two Sum II problem leverages the fact that the input array is sorted to optimize the solution.  A brute-force approach (checking every pair) would be O(n\u00b2), but we can achieve O(n) using the Two Pointers technique.\n\nHere's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef two_sum(numbers, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds two indices in a sorted array whose elements sum to the target.\n\n    Args:\n        numbers: A sorted list of integers.\n        target: The target sum.\n\n    Returns:\n        A list containing the 1-based indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.\n        Returns an empty list if no such pair exists.\n    \"\"\"\n    left = 0\n    right = len(numbers) - 1\n\n    while left < right:\n        current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]\n\n        if current_sum == target:\n            # Found the pair!

The function returns a list containing the 1-based indices (`left + 1`, `right + 1`).\n   - `elif current_sum < target`: If the sum is less than the target, it means we need a larger sum.  We move the `left` pointer one step to the right to consider a larger number.\n   - `else`: If the sum is greater than the target, we need a smaller sum. We move the `right` pointer one step to the left to consider a smaller number.\n\n5. **No Pair Found:**\n   - If the loop completes without finding a pair ( `left` becomes greater or equal to `right`), it means no such pair exists, and an empty list is returned.\n\n\nThis Two Pointers approach efficiently finds the solution in O(n) time complexity because it iterates through the array only once. The space complexity is O(1) because we use only a constant amount of extra space.\n",

This represents the accumulated profit.\n\n2. **Iteration:** The code iterates through the `prices` list, starting from the second element (index 1).  We compare each price with the previous day's price.\n\n3. **Profit Calculation:** If the current price (`prices[i]`) is greater than the previous day's price (`prices[i-1]`), it means we can make a profit by buying on the previous day and selling on the current day.  The profit for this transaction (`prices[i] - prices[i-1]`) is added to `max_profit`.\n\n4. **Return Value:**  After iterating through all the prices, the function returns the total `max_profit`.\n\n**Why this works:**\n\nThis approach cleverly exploits the fact that we can make as many transactions as we want. By only considering the upward trends, we automatically capture all the profitable opportunities.  We don't need to keep track of buying and selling points individually; the difference between consecutive prices directly gives us the profit from each upward swing. This makes the solution very efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of prices.  The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a few variables to store the profit and iterate through the array.\n",

The larger element is placed at `nums1[p]`, and the corresponding pointer (`p1` or `p2`) is decremented. The `p` pointer is also decremented after each placement.\n\n3. **Remaining Elements:**  After one of the arrays is exhausted, the `while p2 >= 0` loop handles any remaining elements in `nums2`. These are simply copied to the beginning of the available space in `nums1`.\n\n4. **In-place:** The algorithm modifies `nums1` directly without using any extra arrays, fulfilling the in-place requirement.\n\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of O(m + n) because each element is visited and compared at most once. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses only a constant number of extra variables.  This makes it an efficient solution for the problem.\n",

The loop variable `j` represents the element's position within the row (starting from 0).\n\n5. **Base Cases (1s):** If `j` is 0 or `j` is equal to `i` (the first and last elements of each row), a 1 is appended to the `row`.\n\n6. **Recursive Calculation:** Otherwise, the element's value is calculated by summing the two elements directly above it in the previous row: `triangle[i - 1][j - 1] + triangle[i - 1][j]`. This is the core of Pascal's Triangle's definition.\n\n7. **Appending to Triangle:** After generating a complete `row`, it is appended to the `triangle` list.\n\n8. **Return Value:** Finally, the function returns the `triangle` list, which contains all the generated rows of Pascal's Triangle.\n\n\nThis dynamic programming approach efficiently builds the triangle row by row, leveraging the already computed values from previous rows.  This makes it much more efficient than recursive solutions which can suffer from repeated calculations, especially for larger values of `n`.\n",
  "143": "The problem asks us to generate a specific row from Pascal's Triangle.  We can solve this efficiently without generating the entire triangle.  Here's a Python solution with a detailed explanation:\n\n```python\ndef getRow(rowIndex: int) -> list[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the rowIndexth row of Pascal's Triangle.\n\n    Args:\n        rowIndex: The index of the desired row (0-indexed).\n\n    Returns:\n        A list of integers representing the rowIndexth row of Pascal's Triangle.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Handle base cases\n    if rowIndex == 0:\n        return [1]\n    if rowIndex == 1:\n        return [1, 1]\n\n    # Efficiently generate the row\n    previous_row = [1, 1]  # Initialize with the second row\n    for i in range(2, rowIndex + 1):\n        current_row = [1]  # First element is always 1\n        for j in range(len(previous_row) - 1):\n            current_row.append(previous_row[j] + previous_row[j + 1])\n        current_row.append(1)  # Last element is always 1\n        previous_row = current_row\n\n    return previous_row\n\n#Example Usage\nprint(getRow(3))  # Output: [1, 3, 3, 1]\nprint(getRow(0))  # Output: [1]\nprint(getRow(1))  # Output: [1, 1]\nprint(getRow(5)) # Output: [1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1]\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Base Cases:** The code first handles the base cases for `rowIndex` of 0 and 1, which are the first two rows of Pascal's Triangle: `[1]` and `[1, 1]`.\n\n2. **Iterative Approach:**  Instead of building the entire triangle, we iteratively build only the necessary row. We start with the second row (`[1, 1]`).\n\n3. **Generating Subsequent Rows:** The core logic lies within the `for` loop.  For each subsequent row, we:\n   - Initialize `current_row` with `1` (the first element).\n   - Iterate through the `previous_row` calculating the sum of consecutive elements and appending them to `current_row`.\n   - Append `1` to `current_row` (the last element).\n   - Update `previous_row` to `current_row` for the next iteration.\n\n4. **Efficiency:** This approach is more efficient than generating the entire triangle because it only calculates the elements needed for the specified row.  The time complexity is O(rowIndex), and the space complexity is O(rowIndex) as well, since we only store one row at a time.\n\n\nThis solution provides a clear, concise, and efficient way to solve the Pascal's Triangle II problem.  It avoids unnecessary computations and memory usage by focusing only on the required row.\n",

This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.\n\n2. **Iteration and Subtraction Handling:** The `while` loop iterates through the Roman numeral string. The core logic lies in the `if` condition:\n   - `if i + 1 < n and roman_map[roman_string[i]] < roman_map[roman_string[i + 1]]:`: This checks if we're dealing with a subtractive case.  It verifies two conditions:\n     - `i + 1 < n`: Ensures we don't go out of bounds when accessing `roman_string[i + 1]`.\n     - `roman_map[roman_string[i]] < roman_map[roman_string[i + 1]]`:  Checks if the current numeral's value is less than the next numeral's value (indicating subtraction).\n   - If a subtractive case is found,  `result += roman_map[roman_string[i + 1]] - roman_map[roman_string[i]]` calculates the difference and adds it to the `result`. `i += 2` skips the next character because it's already been processed.\n   - Otherwise (additive case), `result += roman_map[roman_string[i]]` simply adds the current numeral's value to the result. `i += 1` moves to the next character.\n\n3. **Error Handling:** The code includes a check for an empty input string at the beginning, returning -1 in that case.  More robust error handling could be added to check for invalid Roman numeral characters or sequences.\n\n4. **Example Usage:** The example section demonstrates how to use the function with several Roman numeral strings and prints the corresponding integer values.  This showcases the function's ability to handle different types of Roman numerals, including subtractive cases.\n\n\nThis solution is efficient because it iterates through the Roman numeral string only once, making its time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the string. The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input string's length.\n",

Regular expressions provide a powerful way to manipulate strings, especially for pattern matching and replacing.\n\n2. **`is_valid_palindrome(s)` function:**\n   - **Cleaning the string:**\n     - `re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', s)`: This line uses a regular expression to remove all characters that are *not* alphanumeric ( `[^a-zA-Z0-9]` ).  The `re.sub()` function replaces these characters with an empty string, effectively removing them.\n     - `.lower()`: This converts the entire string to lowercase, ensuring case-insensitive comparison.\n\n   - **Palindrome check:**\n     - `cleaned_string == cleaned_string[::-1]`: This is the core of the palindrome check.  `[::-1]` is a Python slice that creates a reversed copy of the string.  The comparison directly checks if the cleaned string is equal to its reversed version. This is a very efficient method compared to iterative comparisons.\n\n\n3. **Example Usage:** The code demonstrates the function's usage with several example strings, showcasing its ability to handle various scenarios, including strings with punctuation and spaces.\n\n\n**Why this approach is efficient:**\n\n* **Regular expressions:** Using `re.sub()` for string cleaning is concise and efficient for complex pattern matching.  It avoids manual character-by-character iteration.\n* **Slicing for reversal:**  `[::-1]` provides a Pythonic and efficient way to reverse a string without explicit looping.\n* **Direct comparison:**  Comparing the cleaned string to its reversed version directly is computationally faster than iterating through the string and comparing characters pairwise.\n\n\nThis solution prioritizes clarity, efficiency, and leverages Python's built-in capabilities for string manipulation to provide a robust and readable solution to the Valid Palindrome problem.\n",
  "146": "This solution uses two stacks to implement a queue.  One stack (`stack1`) is used for enqueue operations, and the other (`stack2`) is used to facilitate dequeue operations.

This is a constant time O(1) operation.\n\n3. **`dequeue()`:** This is where the core logic lies.\n   - It first checks if the queue is empty. If so, it raises an `IndexError`.\n   - If `stack2` (the dequeue stack) is empty, it iterates through `stack1`, popping each element and pushing it onto `stack2`. This effectively reverses the order of elements, making the originally first-in element now at the top of `stack2`.\n   - Finally, it pops and returns the top element from `stack2`.  The time complexity of dequeue is O(n) in the worst case (when `stack2` is empty and all elements need to be transferred).  In the average case (when some elements remain in `stack2`), it's O(1).\n\n4. **`peek()`:**  Similar to `dequeue()`, it checks for emptiness, transfers elements from `stack1` to `stack2` if necessary, and then returns the top element of `stack2` without removing it.  The time complexity is similar to `dequeue()`, O(n) worst case, O(1) average case.\n\n5. **`isEmpty()`:** Checks if both stacks are empty, indicating an empty queue.  This is a constant time O(1) operation.\n\n**Time Complexity:**\n\n* `enqueue`: O(1)\n* `dequeue`: O(n) in the worst case, O(1) amortized\n* `peek`: O(n) in the worst case, O(1) amortized\n* `isEmpty`: O(1)\n\n**Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue.  We are using two stacks, and in the worst case, both stacks can hold up to n elements.  The amortized space complexity is also O(n).\n\n\nThe use of two stacks makes the implementation a bit less efficient than a single queue implementation for dequeue and peek operations in the worst case. However, it elegantly solves the problem of implementing a queue using only stack operations.  The amortized time complexity makes it a reasonable approach in many scenarios.\n",
  "147": "This solution uses two queues to efficiently implement a stack.

This takes O(1) time.\n\n3. **`pop()`:** This is where the cleverness lies.  To get the last element (LIFO), we move all elements *except* the last one from `q1` to `q2`. The last element remaining in `q1` is then the top element, which we remove and return. Finally, we swap `q1` and `q2` so that `q1` is ready for the next operation. This operation is O(n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the stack.\n\n4. **`top()`:**  Similar to `pop()`, but instead of removing the top element, we put it back into `q1` after retrieving it. This allows us to peek at the top element without altering the stack.  This is also O(n).\n\n5. **`empty()`:** Checks if `q1` is empty, indicating an empty stack. This takes O(1) time.\n\n**Time and Space Complexity:**\n\n* **`push`:** O(1) time, O(1) space\n* **`pop`:** O(n) time, O(1) space\n* **`top`:** O(n) time, O(1) space\n* **`empty`:** O(1) time, O(1) space\n\nThe space complexity is O(n) overall because we are storing the elements in the queues.  Note that using a single queue would make `pop` and `top` O(n) because you'd have to dequeue and enqueue all elements to reach the last one.  Using two queues optimizes the  `pop` and `top` operations compared to a single-queue solution, although `push` remains efficient.\n",
  "148": "Several approaches can solve the \"Power of Two\" problem. Here are two Python solutions with detailed explanations:\n\n**Method 1: Bit Manipulation**\n\nThis method is the most efficient.  Powers of two have only one bit set to 1 in their binary representation (e.g., 1 = 0001, 2 = 0010, 4 = 0100, 8 = 1000).  We can leverage this property using the bitwise AND operator (`&`).\n\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two_bitwise(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if n is a power of two using bit manipulation.\n\n  Args:\n    n: An integer.\n\n  Returns:\n    True if n is a power of two, False otherwise.  Returns False for n <= 0.\n  \"\"\"\n  if n <= 0:\n    return False\n  return (n & (n - 1)) == 0\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_power_of_two_bitwise(1))   # True\nprint(is_power_of_two_bitwise(2))   # True\nprint(is_power_of_two_bitwise(4))   # True\nprint(is_power_of_two_bitwise(7))   # False\nprint(is_power_of_two_bitwise(16))  # True\nprint(is_power_of_two_bitwise(0))   # False\nprint(is_power_of_two_bitwise(-8))  # False\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handle Negative and Zero:** We first check if `n` is less than or equal to 0.  Powers of two are positive.\n\n2. **Bitwise AND:** The core logic lies in `(n & (n - 1)) == 0`.  Let's consider an example:\n\n   - If `n` is a power of two (e.g., `n = 8` which is `1000` in binary), then `n - 1` will be `7` (`0111`).\n   - Performing a bitwise AND (`&`) between `1000` and `0111` results in `0000`.\n\n   If `n` is *not* a power of two (e.g., `n = 7` which is `0111`), then `n - 1` is `6` (`0110`).\n   - The bitwise AND between `0111` and `0110` is `0110`, which is not 0.\n\nTherefore, `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` is `True` only when `n` is a power of two.\n\n\n**Method 2: Repeated Division**\n\nThis method is less efficient than the bit manipulation approach but is more intuitive.  We repeatedly divide `n` by 2 until it becomes 1. If at any point the remainder is not 0, or the result becomes less than 1, then `n` is not a power of two.\n\n```python\ndef is_power_of_two_division(n):\n  \"\"\"\n  Checks if n is a power of two using repeated division.\n\n  Args:\n    n: An integer.\n\n  Returns:\n    True if n is a power of two, False otherwise. Returns False for n <= 0.\n  \"\"\"\n  if n <= 0:\n    return False\n  while n % 2 == 0:\n    n //= 2\n  return n == 1\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_power_of_two_division(1))   # True\nprint(is_power_of_two_division(2))   # True\nprint(is_power_of_two_division(4))   # True\nprint(is_power_of_two_division(7))   # False\nprint(is_power_of_two_division(16))  # True\nprint(is_power_of_two_division(0))   # False\nprint(is_power_of_two_division(-8))  # False\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThe `while` loop repeatedly divides `n` by 2 as long as it's even. If `n` is a power of two, this process will eventually reduce it to 1. If at any point the remainder is not 0, it means `n` is not divisible by 2 at some step, hence not a power of two.  If the loop finishes and `n` is not 1, it's also not a power of two.\n\n\nThe bit manipulation method (`is_power_of_two_bitwise`) is generally preferred due to its superior efficiency, especially for larger numbers.  The repeated division method is easier to understand conceptually.  Choose the method that best suits your needs and understanding.\n",
  "149": "The most efficient way to solve the \"Power of Three\" problem without loops or recursion is to leverage the properties of logarithms and the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.\n\n**Python Solution:**\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef isPowerOfThree(n: int) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if n is a power of three without using loops or recursion.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The integer to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if n is a power of three, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False  #Powers of three are always positive\n\n    log_base_3 = math.log(n, 3)  # Calculate the base-3 logarithm of n\n    return log_base_3.is_integer() #Check if the logarithm is an integer\n\n```\n\n**Detailed Explanation:**\n\n1. **Handle the Base Cases:** If `n` is less than or equal to 0, it cannot be a power of three.  Powers of three are always positive integers.\n\n2. **Logarithm Calculation:** The core idea is to use logarithms. If `n` is a power of three (n = 3<sup>i</sup>), then the base-3 logarithm of `n` (log\u2083(n)) will be an integer (`i`).  We use `math.log(n, 3)` to calculate the base-3 logarithm.\n\n3. **Integer Check:**  The `is_integer()` method directly checks if the result of the logarithm is an integer.  This avoids any explicit looping or recursion.  If it's an integer, it means `n` is a power of three; otherwise, it's not.\n\n\n**Why this is efficient and avoids loops/recursion:**\n\nThe `math.log()` function is highly optimized in Python's math library.  It uses efficient numerical algorithms to compute the logarithm, avoiding the need for iterative or recursive approaches. The `is_integer()` check is a simple and fast operation.  This makes the solution significantly faster than an iterative or recursive approach, especially for larger values of `n`.\n\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```python\nprint(isPowerOfThree(27))  # Output: True\nprint(isPowerOfThree(12))  # Output: False\nprint(isPowerOfThree(1))   # Output: True\nprint(isPowerOfThree(0))   # Output: False\nprint(isPowerOfThree(-9))  # Output: False\n```\n\n**Important Note on Floating-Point Precision:**\n\nWhile this solution is generally effective, you should be aware of the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.  For extremely large values of `n`,  the logarithm calculation might introduce a tiny amount of numerical error, potentially leading to a false negative (i.e., `log_base_3.is_integer()` returns `False` even though `n` is theoretically a power of three).  However, this is unlikely to be a problem for most practical input ranges.  For extremely high precision, a different approach might be necessary (e.g., using a specialized library for arbitrary-precision arithmetic).\n",

Powers of four (1, 4, 16, 64, ...) have only one bit set, and that bit is always at an even position (counting from the right, starting at 0).\n\n```python\ndef isPowerOfFour(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if n is a power of four using bit manipulation.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The integer to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if n is a power of four, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if only one bit is set\n    if (n & (n - 1)) != 0:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if the set bit is at an even position\n    return (n & 0x55555555) == n  # 0x55555555 is a bitmask with bits set at even positions\n\n\n#Example Usage\nprint(isPowerOfFour(16))  # True\nprint(isPowerOfFour(5))   # False\nprint(isPowerOfFour(64))  # True\nprint(isPowerOfFour(0))   # False\nprint(isPowerOfFour(-16)) # False\n\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`if n <= 0:`:** Handles the base case where n is not positive. Powers of four are always positive.\n\n2. **`if (n & (n - 1)) != 0:`:** This is a clever bit manipulation trick.  Subtracting 1 from a power of four clears the least significant set bit.  The bitwise AND (`&`) operation will only be zero if only one bit was set initially.  If the result is not zero, it means more than one bit was set, so it's not a power of four.\n\n3. **`return (n & 0x55555555) == n`:** This checks if the single set bit is at an even position.  `0x55555555` is a hexadecimal number where bits at even positions are set (01010101...). The bitwise AND operation will only result in the original number `n` if the set bit in `n` is at an even position.\n\n**Method 2: Logarithm (Less Efficient)**\n\nThis method uses logarithms to find the exponent. It's less efficient than the bit manipulation approach but provides a different perspective.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef isPowerOfFour_log(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Determines if n is a power of four using logarithms.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The integer to check.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if n is a power of four, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n <= 0:\n        return False\n    log_base_4 = math.log(n, 4)\n    return log_base_4 == int(log_base_4) #check if the logarithm is an integer\n\n#Example Usage\nprint(isPowerOfFour_log(16))  # True\nprint(isPowerOfFour_log(5))   # False\nprint(isPowerOfFour_log(64))  # True\nprint(isPowerOfFour_log(0))   # False\nprint(isPowerOfFour_log(-16)) # False\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **`if n <= 0:`:** Again, handles the base case.\n\n2. **`log_base_4 = math.log(n, 4)`:** Calculates the base-4 logarithm of n.  If n is a power of four, this will be an integer.\n\n3. **`return log_base_4 == int(log_base_4)`:** Checks if the logarithm is an integer.  Floating-point comparisons can be slightly imprecise, but in this case, it usually works well for reasonably sized integers.\n\n\n**Recommendation:**  The bit manipulation method (`isPowerOfFour`) is significantly faster and more efficient than the logarithm method (`isPowerOfFour_log`), especially for larger numbers.  Therefore, it's the preferred solution.  The logarithm approach is included for completeness and to illustrate an alternative algorithm.\n"
